Since the 1950s, the city experienced an economic miracle, withstood numerous financial crises, and is in the process of economic restructuring. Politically, it has turned from \u201cthe last Colony\u201d of Great Britain into a Special Administrative Region of the PRC. Culturally, the flourishing Canto pop-culture coincides with the emergence of a local identity. Using a sociological perspective, this course critically reflects on the impact of these profound changes on the construction of the so-called \u2018Hong Kong identity\u2019. Who is a HongKongese? This seemingly simple question underlies critical issues and boundaries about nationality, ethnicity, language, culture, class, and citizenship. The construction of a Hong Kong identity necessitates the drawing of boundaries that include and exclude, defines who is entitled to resources and power and who is not, and projects differential expectations of rights and responsibilities on insiders and outsiders. The question thus has profound impacts on how resources and power are distributed in society, and affects the life chances of individuals, families and society.(Advisory: Not for Sociology Majors.)", "outcome": "        \u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u671f\u671b\u9054\u5230\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e94\u500b\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u679c:  \u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u5e0c\u671b\u900f\u904e\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b, \u4ee5\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u7684\u8996\u91ce\u53bb\u5e6b\u52a9\u540c\u5b78\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u6230\u5f8c\u7d93\u6b77\u904e\u7684\u7d93\u6fdf\u767c\u5c55, \u653f\u6cbb\u8b8a\u5316, \u53ca\u6587\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u885d\u64ca\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u53ca\u6279\u5224\u6027\u7684\u4e86\u89e3;  2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u80fd\u5920\u5168\u9762\u601d\u8003\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u5efa\u69cb\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u793e\u6703, \u7d93\u6fdf\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u74b0\u5883\u5f71\u97ff, \u4e26\u660e\u767d\u8eab\u4efd\u5efa\u69cb\u80cc\u6240\u6d89\u7684\u6b0a\u5229\u8207\u7fa9\u52d9, \u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u8207\u7d93\u6fdf\u8cc7\u6e90\u5206\u914d.  \u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u793e\u6703\u8b8a\u9077 (social change) \u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u8a0e\u8ad6\u8eab\u4efd. \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u660e\u767d\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u9019\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u5efa\u69cb\u8207\u9999\u6e2f\u904e\u53bb\u534a\u4e16\u7d00\u7684\u793e\u6703\u6539\u8b8a, \u5305\u62ec\u672c\u571f\u5316, \u53bb\u5de5\u696d\u5316, \u7d93\u6fdf\u8f49\u578b, \u5168\u7403\u5316, \u65b0\u4e2d\u7522\u968e\u7d1a\u7684\u8208\u8d77, \u4e3b\u6b0a\u79fb\u4ea4\u7b49\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2.  \u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u8f03\u5b8f\u89c0\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u4e86\u89e3 \u2018\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u2019 \u9019\u500b\u8eab\u4efd\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u793e\u6703\u7d50\u69cb (social structure) \u8207\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u5f71\u97ff; \u4e26\u555f\u767c\u5b78\u751f\u601d\u8003\u2018\u500b\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u2019 (individual identity)\u8207\u7fa4\u9ad4 (groups), \u793e\u5340(communities), \u793e\u6703\u7cfb\u7d71, (systems), \u548c\u5236\u5ea6 (institutions) \u7684\u95dc\u4fc2.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u900f\u904e\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u5f0f, \u5305\u62ec\u5609\u8cd3\u8b1b\u8005,\u591a\u5a92\u9ad4\u5f71\u97f3\u6559\u6750\u64ad\u653e\u53ca\u8a0e\u8ad6, \u548c\u5c0f\u7d44\u5c08\u984c\u7fd2\u4f5c \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u793e\u6703\u7684\u6b77\u53f2, \u7d50\u69cb, \u6587\u5316\u548c\u5728\u9019\u500b\u793e\u6703\u88e1\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u7fa4\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u8f03\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e86\u89e3, \u4ea6\u80fd\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u4ee5\u8f03\u5168\u9762\u5b8f\u89c0\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u601d\u8003\u554f\u984c.

What is it like to live in a city? How do people interact with each other in cities? How is it different from life and social interactions in rural areas or smaller towns? The size and density of cities turn out to make for distinctive ways of living and interacting.\u00a0\u00a0Part II: Industrial and Post-Industrial Cities\u00a0\u00a0This three-week section will consider the changing economic significance of cities in modern society. Why do particular industries cluster together in cities or neighbourhoods? How is globalization and financialization changing cities?

This will touch on phenomena including gentrification and property bubbles.\u00a0\u00a0Part IV: Urban Problems; Whose Solutions?The final four weeks will look at some challenges confronting cities today. How is increasing inquality impacting urban life? How can crises surrounding housing\u00a0availabiliy, control of public space, and climate change be dealt with?

Is inequality an inevitable feature of human life? (b) How many social classes are there? What are the principal? \"fault lines\" or social cleavages that define the class structure? Are these cleavages strengthening or weakening with the transition to advanced industrialism? (c) How frequently do individuals cross occupational or class boundaries? Are educational degrees, social contacts, and \"individual luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions? What other social and institutional forces affect occupational attainment and allocation? (d) How are the lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities of individuals shaped by their class locations? Are there identifiable \"class cultures\" in past and present societies? (e) What types of social processes and state policies serve to maintain or alter racial, ethnic, and sex discrimination in labor markets? Have these forms of discrimination weakened or strengthened with the transition to advanced industrialism? (f) Will stratification systems take on new and distinctive forms in the future?

The course involves discussions of sexualities at different levels, including sexual desires, behaviors, and identities (personal level), sexual norms, sexual cultures and sexual communities (community level) and regulations and laws governing sexualities (societal level).  We will debate how sexualities intersect with other social categories, such as class, age, race and ethnicity, in producing social structure. Throughout the course, it discusses sexualities are bound up with struggles over citizenship, rights, entitlement and inequalities. We also examine how social forces such as globalization, the internet, and medical technologies can reconfigure understanding and expression of sexualities. The course aims to foster an interdisciplinary discussion, with Sociology as its core focus. It can involve controversial and at times emotionally as well as intellectually difficult readings and discussions. As a whole, the course aims to open up space to discuss and debate how we may learn to live with differences in an increasingly diverse world. Topics to be covered: 1.

From the development of iPhone to the Covid-19 vaccine, ours is a society organized around and even controlled by expert knowledge systems. Meanwhile, science itself also underwent increasingly fiercer attack by outsiders, a typical example being the disagreement on whether the climate change is real. Sociology of scientific knowledge offers us a set of tools to understanding and analyzing these heatedly debated big questions in society today. By critically analyzing science, scientists, and the system of knowledge production that they created and maintained, this course surveys major topics and recent developments in the social studies of science. The arrangement of these topics follows a micro-to-macro sequence: First, the course discusses personal level STEM experiences, such as STEM educational pipeline and STEM job market; then, the course discusses institutional and disciplinary level analysis of how science works and how innovations come about; lastly, the course moves on to society, national, and international level of the impact of science, using examples from the platform economy, the international politics and the global pandemic.

With a comparative perspective, this course focuses on how governments and law enforcement agencies in different societies intervene in the breaking of laws in a globalized world. The course begins by introducing various concepts of social control from a sociological standpoint. In addition to a review of the relevant criminological theories and empirical research findings, the course assesses the major impact of globalization on public security and explores the proliferation of transnational criminal activities in the process. Finally, the course will examine how social control agencies react and seek to address these problems in local and global context.", "outcome": "By the end of the course, the students are expected to: have acquired a good knowledge on how criminological theories can help them to understand the relationship between crime and social control understand the risks and challenges posed to public security in different societies by the process of globalization  recognize how some social control measures are conducted locally and in overseas to combat against crimes be able to apply sociological perspectives and insights to review and assess the effectiveness of social control measures in different jurisdictions", "syllabus": "Week 1Introduction: Theoretical Approaches to Social ControlRequired Readings:Chriss, J.

Through in-depth case studies of exemplary empirical studies based on randomized experimental/quasi-experimental designs, the course will demonstrate how basic research could help understand human attitudes/perceptions/behaviors and provide evidence-based guidance for policymaking.This course is intended for students in their third or fourth year of college. The course coverage will be helpful to students who intend to pursue more advanced academic training, government sector jobs that place a premium on program evaluation and quantitative literacy, or service industry jobs that have witnessed a surging demand for big data applications. A one-term course on basic statistics is essential for understanding the technical but elementary terms used in this course. Still, math and statistical skills are not required to excel in this course.Specifically, the course is designed to achieve three learning objectives:1. To master the generalized experimental methodology by studying the core principles of experimental designs and some exemplary social science experimental studies. 2. To ask real-world questions that can be answered with randomized experiments (of various forms) to understand human perceptions/behaviors, induce behavioral changes, and inform evidence-based policymaking.3. To gain intuitive understanding of the counterfactual paradigm for causal thinking (i.e., using quasi-experimental designs) when truly randomized experiments are infeasible.Evaluation of learning progress and performance will closely align with the course objectives. The course assessments would emphasize the conceptual and empirical understandings of experimental designs and their real-world applications through a group project presentation and a short research proposal written by individuals.

Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating?This course surveys major approaches and areas in the sociological study of health, illness and medicine.
