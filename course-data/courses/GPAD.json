These theories were selected because of their direct relevance for developing an understanding of modern government behaviour. \u00a0 Public administration is often considered in a managerial manner, as little more than control and straightforward analysis of efficiency and economy. This is not necessarily the case. People from different walks of life tend to have different expectations of government. This course is intended to foster a change in attitudes among students. After the course, students are expected to have the ability and tendency to think critically from multidisciplinary perspectives and to provide a critical appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of any theoretical approach. Most important of all, by taking this course, students should have developed an understanding of the basic concepts and theories in public administration and should have gained the ability to apply them to the context of Hong Kong. Public administration, as an area of study, is very much a study based in American context. Therefore, it is important for students to reflect on the concepts and approaches covered in the course, and to consider how they can contribute to a better understanding of public administration in Hong Kong. The course is intended to reinforce communication skills on the part of students. Through the training in debates and discussions, students should have developed the ability to convey abstract ideas and complicated issues in a concrete and organized manner.", "syllabus": "Teaching Plan and Readings (* required readings)\u00a0\u00a0Part I.

The notion of \u2018governance\u2019 has taken shape out of the fact that governments are now facing a much more limited role in supplying public goods and organising societies. Their activities and decisions have been increasingly transferred to the private sector, NGOs, quangos and international organisations, even to the extent that public policy has been \u2018hollowed out\u2019. As such, this course depicts a general picture of contextual challenges confronting governments in public policy. The features and effects of globalisation, regionalization, marketisation, privatisation and the dynamism of civil society are discussed. In addition, the course discusses the ways in which governments have attempted to cope with these contextual uncertainties. Faced with the changing context, governments in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century are developing new mechanisms to influence populations. These new mechanisms contain: rationality, regulation, surveillance, risk and moral politics. While governments have undergone change, they may be more or less powerful than in the past.", "outcome": "The course will furnish students with the following capabilities and skills:\u00a0By the end of this course students should be able to demonstrate an awareness of the fact that the environment in which government has to make policy and organise society has substantially changed. In particular, the students are expected to develop an in-depth knowledge of selected concepts so that they can explain and interpret the difficulties confronting contemporary governments in making public policy.\u00a0Throughout the course students are expected to uncover and discuss the new mechanisms of state power, including rationality, regulation, surveillance and risk management, and to the impact they have had. Consequently, the students should have the ability to analyse the fact that these new mechanisms have not just affected how governments operate but also what they do and their relations with the general public. The governments of twenty-first century are different from those in the past decades.\u00a0The course takes an international perspective in discussing the changes in government and the policy process. Case studies of developed countries such as Britain and America and developing states such as Argentina will be used to illustrate the concepts and theories highlighted in the course. Arguably, Hong Kong has also been under the crisis of declining ability to govern. Students are expected to have the ability to draw on the foreign cases and apply them to the analysis of public policy and public administration in Hong Kong.\u00a0The course is intended to reinforce communication and problem-solving skills on the part of students. They should be able to convey abstract ideas and complicated issues in a concrete and organised manner. Perhaps more importantly, the course emphasises the skills of independent research on the part of students, who are expected to identity governing problems and use foreign experiences to combat governing problems in the context of Hong Kong.", "syllabus": "The major topics to be covered by this course include:\u00a0\u00a01.)

To catalyze your learning, this course will provide practical and contemporary examples throughout the course. Part I of the course provides a brief historical background to European politics and sets the scene for the course. The course starts out by examining how and why the European Union was formed alongside the traditional political landscape in Europe that is largely considered as stable in terms of voting and political behavior. Important theoretical concepts are introduced in Part I of the course, in examining theoretically how contemporary 'populism' is defined and conceptualized in the 21st century political landscape. Two divergent concepts, in the form of (a) right-wing populism and (b) left-wing populism are introduced, with key examples from contemporary European politics drawn on to further enhance students' learning.Students are then introduced to the key theoretical debates on populism in the academic literature and are allowed to make critical evaluations about how they themselves will define populism as a political ideology.Part II of the course provides the main focus of the course, in focusing on the main causes and drivers that have led to the growth of (a) radical right-wing populism and (b) radical left-wing populism.Three key approaches are drawn on in Part II of the course, with comparative studies, survey research (public opinion) and case studies across Western Europe and Central-Eastern Europe allowing students to understand about the diversity and variations of populism in the contemporary political landscape. Students are then introduced to an important case study in the form of the landmark 2016 Brexit vote.Flipped classroom learning will be adopted here, with students watching and then having a critical debate based on a special documentary and discussing the role that radical right-wing populism and Euroscepticism has played in the Brexit vote and the future of the British political system. Students will also be tasked to work in groups and make group project presentations on a topic of their choice that relates to populism.Part III of the course introduces students to critical debates and evaluations on the 'rise' of populism and just how important understanding this political phenomenon is for (a) the implications for contemporary democracy and governance in EU member states, alongside (b) how populism on the 'right' and 'left' of the political spectrum is challenging the future EU project. Students are provided with a unique learning experience, with a practical and special Data Lab session that allows them to understand the root causes of populism, through a series of applied public opinion surveys (drawing on the Eurobarometer) and data analysis.The final part of the course also allows students to understand the wider roots that right-wing and left-wing populism has had in shaking up the contemporary political landscape. Latest articles from academic research alongside newspaper and op-ed articles will be deployed to further enhance the overall student learning experience. In particular, the 'rise' of populist parties on the left and right will be linked to the electoral decline of mainstream social democratic parties in Europe.Students will also be provided with a Special Guest Lecture, with a key speaker (European expert) from the Europe Asia Policy Centre for Comparative Research (EAP) coming in to share their own personal experiences, in outlining the role that populism has played in challenging the governance of the European Union and its key institutions. This session will also allow students to further their understanding of how the European Union works and most importantly allow students to ask questions from the guest speaker and further enhance their overall learning experience in an interactive setting. Students are also encouraged to draw on their own personal backgrounds and experience, in drawing on comparisons and making links between the causes of 'populism' in the European context, to the causes of 'localism' in the Hong Kong context.The final part of the course also revisits the premise and assumption made in Part I of the course, about the historical stability of the European political landscape by outlining how 'a new form of politics' now exists in European politics. Stability and patterns of partisan alignment have now been replaced by instability and widespread patterns of electoral volatility. Thus, by the end of the course students will able to trace the historical evolution of European Politics and most importantly, the challenges that a number of contemporary European Union (EU) countries are facing in terms of their governance amidst the 'rise' of populist radical right and left-wing parties alike in the 21st century.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3190", "title": "Politics of Development", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Seminar", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Government & Public Admin PC", "requirements": "", "description": "Examination of theories of political and administrative development.

Major topics covered include the origins of regulation and its development, regulatory strategies and tools, policy dilemmas in regulatory standard-setting, regulatory enforcement, regulatory competition, and the evaluation of regulation. The general backdrop of the course is the development of what has been called the \u2018regulatory state\u2019 emerging in the era of privatisation since the early 1980s, and the term \u2018risk society\u2019 coined in the 1990s in the debate of modernisation. Over the past decades, the transferred role of states from positive service provider to regulator and the regulation of risk have attracted intense scrutiny from social scientists. In the discipline of political science, the main academic debates focus on the design of regulatory regimes, tools and strategies deployed, the regulation of risk in different socio-economic and political institutional settings, and the interactive dynamics between regulators and other actors inside the \u2018regulatory space\u2019. This course functions as a general introduction to regulation. The emphasis is laid mainly on exploration and discussion of conceptual and theoretical questions. Empirical evidence is drawn from experience in developed countries as well as industrialising economies.
