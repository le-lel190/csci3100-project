Perhaps we are most aware of this kind of creativity when we read imaginative literature, whether classic or contemporary; but we also experience it directly in our own everyday language use. This course aims to foster new understandings of the various ways in which language influences and shapes the experiences of life common to all humanity. Students learn to analyze and appreciate a wide range of literary, linguistic and cultural phenomena, including the works of Hong Kong authors/poets who express themselves through English. From a linguistic perspective, we examine the ways in which language is structured and used creatively for different purposes in both local and global contexts. From a literary perspective, we study not only the traditional genres of fiction, poetry, and drama, but also film, song, and life writing. From a cultural perspective, we investigate how different texts and media are part of how we construct the world and define our evolving sense of self and our common humanity.", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course students should be better able to: \u00a0- describe the central role of language in the creation and discovery of meaning; \u00a0- demonstrate a critical appreciation of the ways in which form, structure, and language shape meanings in literary texts; \u00a0- discuss the historical contexts of the globalization of English and their cultural consequences; \u00a0- synthesize information and ideas drawn from various sources, and evaluate critically opposing positions; \u00a0- describe how language and literature express individual and human values within an historical and sociocultural context; \u00a0- think imaginatively and analytically, and develop creative, ethical solutions to problems; \u00a0- express ideas with clarity, coherence, creativity, and fluency in both written and oral communication; \u00a0- use these new understandings as a basis for further studies in the humanities.", "syllabus": "Unit I: Imagination, critical thinking and creative expression through language and literature \u00a0\u2022 Conceptions of creativity and critical thinking \u00a0\u2022 Imagination and intellectual curiosity \u00a0\u2022 Culture and the central role of language and literature in the creation of meaning \u00a0\u2022 Language, literature and the study of the humanities \u00a0\u00a0Unit II.

The history of human rights has always been accompanied by literary texts; conversely, some of the most important literary texts in the world have focused on human rights issues. People who have suffered abuse and human rights violations have often articulated their painful stories in a variety of literary genres \u2014 in the hope of being heard, achieving recognition, bearing witness to events that have defined their lives. These stories thus constitute important documents around which rights campaigns and communities are built. During the course, we will look at the history of human rights literature, as well as various case studies \u2014 including Stolen Generation narratives in Australia, narratives by women who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army, political dissident narratives, and more recent refugee literature.

Week 5   Topic: The Ethics of Existence   Description: This week, we explore the relationship between individual freedom and moral responsibility.      Week 6   Topic: Alienation and Guilt   Description: Guilt and alienation are some of the major themes in existentialist literature. This lecture explains how Kafka and Ionesco address these themes.      Week 7   Topic: Authentic Living, Das Man, Subjects and Objects   Description: What is meant by an \u2018authentic\u2019 life\u2014as opposed to a life of gestures, illusions, and performances?

Environmental writing is also political engagement (biopolitics, as it were) as the ultimate aim of environmental writing is to effect policy change to protect, nurture, and sustain the environment and humankind. In this course, we will explore how to use different modes and genres of writing to effect environmental change. We will first examine the major elements of environmental writing through the exploration of different modes and genres, including children\u2019s books, blogs, essays, poetry, songs, social media, Apps, newspaper articles, and posters. We will then examine the major environmental issues we are facing globally and in Hong Kong, and examine how environmental writing is currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and effect change. We will also investigate public awareness of the major environmental issues facing Hong Kong, to develop an understanding of how we can engage the public more effectively through writing. Finally, we will engage in our own environmental writing by creating three pieces of environmental writing, each examining the same environmental issue through a different type of writing. Key questions this course explores:\u2022 How can we use writing to raise awareness of environmental issues and effect environmental change?\u2022 What are the most pressing local and global environmental issues we face today? How is environmental writing currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and the government to respond to these issues?

The course then examines relationship between Hong Kong English and Hong Kong culture from cultural, social, historical, and educational perspectives, particularly in relation to and juxtaposition from Cantonese and Putonghua. The second part of the course examines both spoken and written features of HKE, including grammar, discourse particles, vocabulary, and pronunciation, as well as the practices of code-mixing and code-switching. This section of the course also focuses on the social impact of the use of these features in Hong Kong culture. In the third part of the course, language attitudes and ideologies towards \u2018standard\u2019 language varieties (for example American and British English) in relation to HKE will be explored. The course will also examine the relationship between use of HKE and social identity as well as gender in Hong Kong culture.", "outcome": " By the end of the course, students should be able to:   understand the cultural, social, historical and linguistic development of Hong Kong English in relation to the major conceptual frameworks the course has explored;   critically examine how language attitudes and standard language ideologies develop in different societies, and how gender and identity impact attitudes and ideologies across cultures;  demonstrate an understanding of language attitudes and cultures through original research on the attitudes towards and status of Hong Kong English in Hong Kong society;   define and give examples of different features of Hong Kong English;    conduct original research on either written or spoken features of Hong Kong English;    read and analyze research on Hong Kong English;    use technology to conduct research on Hong Kong English;    become more digitally literate through the reading, analysis, and writing of online Hong Kong English content.   \u00a0", "syllabus": " Week 1 \u2022 Introduction: syllabus, reading material, teaching method The first week will introduce students to the course and the course syllabus. \u2022 No reading \u00a0 Week 2 \u2022 Topic: New varieties of English \u00a0\u00a0 In week 2, the \u2018how\u2019 of Hong Kong English will be discussed, and key frameworks to analyze the evolution of new Englishes will be examined. \u2022 Reading: Hansen Edwards 2018 Chapter 2 \u00a0 Week 3 \u2022 Topic: A social and linguistic history of English in Hong Kong \u00a0\u00a0 In week 3, the \u2018how\u2019 of Hong Kong English will continued to be examined through the presentation of a social, cultural, and linguistic history of Hong Kong, which emphasizes the history and status of English in Hong Kong society in juxtaposition to both Cantonese and Putonghua. \u2022 Reading: Hansen Edwards 2018 Chapter 1; Chan, 2002; Evans, 2017 \u00a0 Week 4 \u2022 Topic: What\u2019s in a name?

Although English has long spread around the world, the consequences of this spread are only now beginning to be appreciated by speakers in diverse cultures and societies. English has changed the world, impacting specific local cultures in both positive and negative ways. But English has also been localized and acculturated, made to express the realities of diverse cultures and societies, and so the language has been changed in turn. The discourse of world Englishes aims to re-imagine our understanding of the language. The difference between error and innovation can no longer be decided by reference to \u2018ownership\u2019 of the language. Additionally, the language is beginning to be a medium of the expression of identity for more and more people in very different social and cultural contexts. World English must be pluralized, which is why we think in terms of world Englishes. This course is split into two sections. The first section will introduce you to issues in the discourse of world Englishes: innovation, variety, creativity, globalization, etc. The second section will look at specific case studies in different cultures and societies, and will focus on Asian Englishes, e.g. English in Singapore, China, and Japan. Different Asian cultures have distinct historical experiences with English, leading to different levels of cultural penetration (e.g. in popular culture) and depth of function (e.g. in business and law). The second section looks at different examples to explore their specific cultural engagements with the English language, but also to identify what they have in common: Japan English and Singlish develop in very different cultures, but the course with emphasis comparison as well as contrast.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2620", "title": "Acquisition of English As a Second Language", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of English", "requirements": "", "description": "This course is developed to introduce key concepts in learning English as a second language (L2) from a range of theoretical perspectives such as linguistic approach (e.g., universal grammar), interactionist approach (e.g., the Interaction hypothesis), frequency-based approach (e.g., connectionism) and sociocultural approach (e.g., constructivism).

Given that\u00a0discourse analysis is concerned with the systematic and careful examination of a variety of texts, this course will be\u00a0organized according to the various ways linguists may interpret the notion of text.\u00a0This semester, we begin with a general review of discourse analysis as a field of linguistic study. Then, we follow that\u00a0discussion with an overview of various rhetorical and linguistic approaches to the analysis of texts as written discourse,\u00a0examining non-fiction (essays) and literary texts. Our stylistic analyses of writing includes the study of rhetorical aspects\u00a0(aims, purpose, rhetorical situation, style, discourse blocs, modes of development, voice/persona, tone, attitude, and\u00a0readability) and syntactic matters (i.e., lexical, phrasal, and clausal use). With an understanding of this approach, we use it to\u00a0analyze student-written essays; in addition, we consider what our findings may suggest about the texts and their writers,\u00a0with a view to identifying strategies for possible rewriting and revising.\u00a0Moving from text as written discourse, we adopt a broad notion of the term text as both written and spoken discourse. Primarily\u00a0using the work of text-linguists, we consider structures \u201cbeyond the sentence.\u201d That is, we now view the idea of a text as\u00a0any passage, either spoken or written, of whatever length, that forms a unified whole; and we consider what makes a text\u00a0\u201cgood\u201d or \u201csuccessful\u201d in terms of information flow (the way ideas are dispersed throughout a text) , coherence (global\u00a0concern that indicates a text is unified), and cohesion (local or surface concern that serve to link one idea and sentence to\u00a0the next one in a text). Again, once we complete some cohesion and information flow analyses, we look at practical ways\u00a0we might apply some of the key ideas in teaching and learning situations in Hong Kong.\u00a0Finally, we conclude with the notion of text as talking\u2014oral exchanges. We will analyze naturally-occurring language in use, i.e.,\u00a0conversational analysis and pragmatics. To do so, we will cover such concepts such as the Gricean maxims and the\u00a0Cooperative Principle (rules and conditions which speakers abide by in effective or \u201chappy\u201d exchanges), implicature\u00a0(indirect meaning), speech acts (social act performed by the uttering of certain words), as well as associated phenomenon\u00a0(e.g., framing, turn-taking, overlap, interruption, adjacency pairs, etc. ). Our study of text as talk will enable us to explore\u00a0how and why people \u201cdo\u201d things with words, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.\u00a0By the end of the course, we hope to have a better understanding of how discourse analysis reveals to us the intricacies of a\u00a0text as well as enhances our knowledge of how such analysis can strengthen our abilities as language users\u2014speakers and\u00a0writers.", "required_readings": "Discourse Analysis Readings.

Very often, approaches to teaching literature, whether at the school or university level, are rather vague and pay little or no attention to the actual language of literary works. Students are often left rather puzzled as to what is expected of them and what they are meant to \u2018get out\u2019 of literary works. The stylistics and cognitive poetics approach to teaching literature gives a concrete orientation to literary pedagogy. It must always start from the students\u2019 own spontaneous responses to a literary work, whether a poem, short story, novel or play. There can be no question of merely teaching students how to carry out some kind of \u2018dry,\u2019 pointless, linguistic description of a literary work. They must be led from their own experiences of a work on to a linguistic and, as we shall see, psychological analysis that helps them to see what it is in the work that gives rise to their own experiences of it. This linguistic and psychological analysis can then further enrich these experiences themselves and lead on to a further round of analysis. This cycle of experience and analysis can then be repeated until it is felt that the work in question has been adequately, or at least significantly, dealt with. Clearly, if someone is to be equipped to carry out this kind of teaching, they must themselves have an adequate knowledge of stylistics and cognitive poetics. This course will therefore both teach this knowledge to its students and investigate how they themselves can then use it to teach their own students, actual or potential. Although stylistics is concerned with the linguistic details of texts, it is important to understand that it is concerned with far more than just that. It has developed over the last thirty or forty years into an exploration of how people read and respond to literary works. This exploration draws upon the tools of linguistics and psychology to see how our minds construct the imaginative worlds of literature. There is always far more to a novel or poem than just the language on the page, though that language is of course our starting point for constructing the novel or poem\u2019s imaginative world and so does itself require close attention. Although this course will be using tools drawn from linguistics and psychology, no particular background in either of these disciplines is presupposed or needed. All the three major forms of literary discourse, poetry, drama and fiction, will be dealt with. A major question of pedagogy is always of course to what extent a teacher should make explicit to their students the knowledge base that they themselves are using in their teaching, that is, just how much of this knowledge base should made be explicit and how much should be left implicit in the actual teaching itself. The balance between explicit and implicit teaching will depend to a very large degree of course on the age and level of the pupils being taught. This issue will be continually addressed throughout the course and ample opportunity will be given for the course\u2019s students to explore it in their mid-term and final papers, which will include options for designing teaching courses of various kinds. Another pedagogical issue that will be addressed is that of using the stylistic and cognitive poetics approaches to literature to combine second language learning with the study of literature in a second language. Second language students have a more explicit knowledge of the grammar of the language they are studying than mother tongue students and this itself is a great advantage in using the stylistic approach; above all, however, a stylistic and cognitive approach to literature in a second language offers great opportunities for deepening second language students\u2019 knowledge of the second langue they are studying, English for example, and their appreciation of its grammatical, lexical and, through the study of poetic metre, even its phonetic subtleties.The basic framework for the study of stylistics and cognitive poetics will be provided by a, freely available, Web based course designed and created by Professor Mick Short of the University of Lancaster. This is an interactive course with lots of exercises for students to do. It is important to grasp that doing stylistics is at least as much a matter of the practical analysis of texts as it is of theoretical exploration. Students will be able to work on the Web-based course in their own time. The classroom sessions will consists of lectures by the teacher that will go more deeply into the issues raised in the Web-based course, together with the practical analyses of texts selected by the teacher.. Students will be divided into small groups for the purpose of these analyses. The combination of in class, practical analysis and the interactive stylistic exercises in the on-line course should provide students with plenty of ideas and materials for developing teaching programmes and tools of their own.

And not just the thematic concern of the canonical literature we all know, but all western literature (or as much of it as we can recover today!)

A central issue underlying the discussions is what possible effect (s) the various classroom processes may bring to the task of acquiring English as a second language (ESL). This will require an examination of the major instructional and noninstructional processes identifi ed in an ESL classroom discourse, a critical evaluation of the observational instruments adopted to date, and a survey of the different types of second language classroom-related research.
