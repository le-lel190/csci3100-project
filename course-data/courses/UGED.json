The second half of the semester considers jazz as a transnationally circulating cultural form that is both a product of and a contributor to globalizing trends, examining jazz\u2019s circulations and permutations in contexts ranging from 1930s Shanghai to present-day West Africa. Through this course, students will gain a familiarity with the history of jazz, some of its major innovators, and its musical characteristics. Critical and close listening will be an important aspect of this course; through in-depth audition and discussion of musical examples, students will gain aural skills that increase their appreciation and understanding of jazz music.

The stories of Beethoven\u2019s broken family, failed love-life, and hearing loss have enthralled Western audiences as much as the sounds of his piano sonatas, string quartets, and symphonies. When the Berlin Wall was demolished in 1989, it was accompanied by Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy.\u201d Yet, despite Western claims to Beethoven\u2019s universality, nowhere else in the non-Western world is Beethoven held in such esteem\u2013except for China. Since the late (if not even early) twentieth century, Beethoven has had more admirers in China than in the West. Who exactly is this Beethoven? And how was it that he, an Austro-German composer who read into Hinduism but never (so far is as currently known) into Confucianism, became a cultural icon both for and of the Chinese? Scholars still just do not know. In this course, we will try to figure it out for ourselves. By listening to and viewing Beethoven\u2019s masterworks and hearing/seeing them in both their original Western and Chinese contexts, we will debate what makes this one person collectively Western, Chinese, and universal (or not). In addition to listening and reading assignments, students will research an independent essay/concert review on Beethoven and his music, whether in Greater China, the West, or both.

This definition implies that successful individuals engage in purposeful, agentic pursuits. Success in attaining task goals confers a feeling of competence; success in reaching relationship goals gives one a feeling of acceptance. Both feelings are major ingredients of mental health. Success in attaining valued goals requires the abilities to adapt to change. These abilities include openness to diverse ideas, cognitive flexibility, creativity, emotional stability, motivation and perseverance. Behavioural research has shown that success is more likely among people who possess several self-attributes. In this course, we will empower students with theoretical and empirical knowledge of these attributes, and engage them in weekly experiential activities, through which they will develop and weave these self-attributes into their daily goal pursuits. Through the use of a self-assessment online platform, student will track their personal growth in these self-attributes. Major aspects of the successful self that will be covered in this course are: the rational self, veridical self-knowledge, the transcendent self, the socially intelligent self, the loved self, the multicultural self, and the global self.This course is closely related to the SDG subgoal of promoting mental health and well-being. First, psychological well-being ensues from attaining one's valued goals. In addition, feeling competent and feeling accepted are two pillars of psychological maturity and mental health.

Death is not special. It happens every day and everywhere. It is also an inevitable part of life. Yet, death is very important for us especially when we are confronted by the death and dying of our loved ones. Surprisingly, we have done little to prepare ourselves to get familiar with the topic of bereavement. Very often we learn it only from the most painful and heartbreaking moments in life\u2014after the death of loved ones. While bereavement may induce us different grief reactions, and adjustment difficulties, it also provides an opportunity for us to experience personal growth, reflect on our values and search for the meaning in life. As a result, this course aims to prepare students to face death, dying and bereavement that they may encounter in their life. In particular, they are facilitated to respond to a unique question, \u201cHow can I live with the grief?\u201d This question can only be answered by the students themselves who will have an opportunity to understand more about death, dying and bereavement, as well as reflecting on their life and living through this course.

The course will highlight the psychological and biological foundations of language, and the applications of linguistics to other fields. Students will develop a basic understanding of language as a computational system that interacts with other cognitive systems of the human brain. The course will also discuss the social aspects of language and the computational processing of human language.

This is a cross-disciplinary course straddles the studies of history, anthropology, and sociology from the perspective of material objects. The course intends to achieve two goals: first, it leads students to identify and appreciate the traditional Chinese values, which include the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism, embodied in the many production types pertinent to what we now regard as Chinese; and second, it explains how those various material types ended up being included and translated as the representative categories of Chinese civilization throughout the historical times. The course will begin from the basic by introducing the mainstream material productions from ancient to modern China: jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, architecture, silk, as well as grave goods. The discussions instruct students to appreciate these essential elements of Chinese culture from the perspectives of their physical qualities, craftsmanship, and historical values. They are also to encourage students to think about the roles of material objects in shaping cultural, ethnic, and even national identities.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students would be able to identify the material and artistic features of some mainstream Chinese artifacts; develop interests in Chinese culture from the perspective of objects; identify key historical sites and remains of pre-modern China; develop acute senses for appreciating traditions and values; develop interests in culture and history; analyze the sources of Chinese heritage and traditions; think critically about historical and other relevant cultural presentations; and get prepared for further trainings in the disciplines of art history, archaeology, anthropology and history.", "syllabus": "1. Introduction: What is the present view about Chinese material culture? \u00a0Present-day China received huge inheritance from the many groups of people and cultural traditions that existed in antiquity. This session introduce a range of material culture that makes up the broad family of Chinese culture. The most important types include jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, and architecture. The definitions given here hope to broaden the scope and include the less-discussed categories of clothing and costumes, sculpture, and grave goods. This overview leads students to consider the many sources of traditional values now embodied in the material culture that we now describe as \u2018Chinese\u2019.\u00a0\u00a02. Jades\u00a0In China, jades have always been understood to have spiritual power and artistic values. What is the scientific definition of jades? How did Confucius and his contemporaries define the roles of jades? How did their teachings shape the understanding of jades in Chinese society? And what are the present views about jades? This session will respond to this question by giving a review of jade history, usage and craftsmanship.\u00a0\u00a03. Antique bronzes\u00a0Among the many treasures inherited from the past, bronzes are core collections that they are always found as representatives of ancient China in modern museums both in China and overseas. This session will describe different categories of bronzes and the motifs found on them in relation to their dates. It will also introduce the imperial collections found in the Kaogu tu, and later on in Xiqing gujian; and explain the values and significance of bronze collections in modern museums. \u00a0\u00a04. Lacquer\u00a0Lacquer is a unique production of ancient China. This session introduces the complicated steps involved in its production, and reviews lacquer-using history in China and in other parts of Asia. The discussion leads student to become aware of the broad transmission of the lacquer-using traditions in Asia that shaped a central role for China in antiquity.\u00a0\u00a05. Sculpture\u00a0In China, sculptural representation is closely tied with religious practices. This session will introduce the Buddhist sites in Henan and Sichuan, as well as the pictorial representations found in the Daoist temples in Hebei. The session will describe the renewed definition of sculpture in the modern times when the Western artistic values were received.\u00a0\u00a06. Architecture\u00a0Architecture forms an essential part of material culture. In China, however, the studies of historical architecture began rather late. This session introduces the classic writings by Liang Sicheng, as well as the renowned Yingcao fasi, the Building Manual composed in the Song period, which founded the standardized Chinese construction works. \u00a0\u00a07. Silk\u00a0Silk production began in the late Neolithic period. This session introduces the traditional steps in silk-making and weaving as found in craftsman handbooks published in the Ming period; and discusses how silk as commodity embodies the rich history of cultural exchange between China and the West through trade.\u00a0\u00a08. Ceramics\u00a0Ceramics are representative productions of south China. This session introduces the production of the classic kilns of Ge, Yu, Ding, Longquan, and Jingdezhen. This session instructs students to identify the colour, texture, decoration, as well as motifs found on the ceramics produced in different areas. They embody rich aesthetic values deemed appropriate in Confucian classics.\u00a0\u00a09. Ornaments\u00a0Chinese ornaments comprise an extended family of motifs that include flowers, birds, figures, beasts, characters, as well as scenes. This session discuss two key groups: plants and dragons. The former was adopted from both nature and religious practices; whereas the latter was acquired through cultural construction over time. This session discusses how the two genres merged along difference courses into what we understand as being Chinese today. \u00a0\u00a010. Chinese calligraphy and paintings\u00a0Chinese calligraphy and paintings represent a major aesthetic system that includes the use of ink and brush, writing, as well as imagination particularly defined in Daoist writings. This session introduces the basic concepts of calligraphy and the features found in the classic paintings from the Song to the Qing periods. \u00a0\u00a011. Grave goods: objects for the deceased \u00a0Mingqi is a unique category of items produced in China. It is a group of goods created especially for the burial with the deceased that they are closely connected with the Chinese ideas about ghosts, spirits, and afterlife. This session will review the history of mingqi from as early as the Bronze Age, and look into how this understanding is translated in modern practice.\u00a0\u00a012. Antique collection and modern consumerism\u00a0The antiquities of China provide a resourceful base for modern designers and cultural industries. In light of modern consuming practices, Chinese designers, architects, museum workers, historians, and other culture-related professionals fall back on inheritance to seek for ideas to create something new and unique for the country. This session reviews the concerns of relevant practitioners. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion \u00a0The concluding session outline the present ideas about material culture and its role in modern society, which is a topic that has become increasingly important in the spheres of anthropology and sociology. This session will combine the discussions on Chinese material culture and the discourse of object studies. This will give students ideas to develop interests in the study of China; and enable them to engage the past with the present.", "required_readings": "Primary textbooks\u00a0i. Dant, Tim.

Mindfulness meditation (MM) is grounded in ancient Buddhist sutras named Anapanasati (\u201cmindfulness breathing\u201d) and Satipatthana (\u201cfoundation of mindfulness\u201d) and 2,500 years of lay and monastic practice. It aims for the practitioner to develop one-pointed concentration on the body, feelings, mind, and dharmas (phenomena), and thereby to reflect on their impermanence, comprehend no-self, and cultivate loving kindness. Over the past decades, a whole range of secular mindfulness practices, or mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), have emerged to serve therapeutic and educational purposes. Students may also explore one or more of such modern applications, and ponder the contribution of mindfulness training to good health and well-being (Sustainable Development Goal 3), and to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as a whole.The course will take students on a one-week retreat in a Buddhist meditation centre, preceded by readings and presentations on relevant topics, and followed by a personal reflection and a mini-research on the experience. Through undisturbed practice of mindfulness meditation away from home and along with peers and monastics, students will master the basic skills of the formal practice and begin to develop a habit of mindful living.

The course concludes that the essence of human existence resides in human subjectivity and values consciousness. Based on such contentions, it will examine the meaning and types of values, and pinpoint the importance of values education to elevate the consciousness of students.

This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.", "outcome": "\u00a0 1.

The basis of moral status, and why human beings are considered to possess moral status form the foundation of the study of bioethics.\u00a0 As human beings are agreed to possess full moral status, this introductory lecture will engage students in a reflection on what humans are by nature, and how human is viewed from the moral perspective, i.e. what are the specific human features that ground human moral status. 2.\u00a0Moral theories: Consequentialist utilitarianism (the consequence of an action e.g. the number of lives that matters most morally) vs. Categorical deontology (the universal principle of the duty of the action itself that matters more morally) using classic trolleyology as example: what matters more? The strengths and limitations of the two main traditional moral theories. 3.\u00a0Moral theories: Principlism.\u00a0Recognize the origin of the 4 pillars of principlism. Identify the bioethical issues and features of scenarios in the medical and healthcare settings. Learn the principlist method to resolve the moral dilemmas identified among the four principles in different scenarios. Recognize the deficiency and limitations of principlism in resolving moral dilemmas - why principlism necessary but inadequate in addressing the dilemma of life and death issues in the public health and healthcare settings. (e.g. Who to save? Decision-making under limited healthcare resources.Treat or not treat? Life-sustaining and standard curative treatments for end-of-life and terminally ill patients.) 4.\u00a0Real life bioethical scenarios in Hong Kong and around the world.\u00a0Start a conversation: the pressing healthcare-related issues in Hong Kong (end-of-life care, organ donation, advanced therapies, Hong Kong Genome Project). Present some landmark and relevant local and international cases of bioethics in clinical and healthcare settings. Illustrate and analyze the moral dilemma and their respective bioethical arguments. Describe means of resolution of these conflicts.\u00a0 5.\u00a0Moral theories: Virtue ethics and character development.\u00a0From social psychology to bioethics: Milgrim Experiment. Does virtue exist in human beings or is it relative? Is pursuing virtue a meaningful project for human beings? Does character matter in bioethics? Describe the relevance of virtue and character to bioethics, power imbalance and coercion, bioethics in experiments and clinical trials (e.g. new drugs for a terminally ill patient), the importance of informed consent and the right to withdraw. 6.\u00a0Beyond reasons in bioethics: Emotions, intuitions, experience, and relationships. Hume\u2019s Sentimentalism as a moral theory (is moral decision governed by emotion or reason more?). How sentimentalism, intuition, experience and relationships influence decision-making in bioethics and healthcare settings. Who to save? Should relationship and feelings matter? Reviewing \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d scenario. Case discussion: organ transplant, resuscitation of terminally ill loved ones/family members, body donation. 7.\u00a0Beyond traditional moral theories in bioethics: Non-Western, religion, care, narrative, and feminist ethics.\u00a0Non-Western ethics: a summary of how Confucianism or other non-Western ethics (e.g. African bioethics) approach bioethical issues. Medical care against cultural or religious beliefs (Jehovah witness, non-therapeutic infant male circumcision).\u00a0Care ethics: Case-based perspective vs principle-based perspective.\u00a0Narrative ethics: An alternative but necessary method to bring particularity and lived experience into bioethics. Feminist ethics: is ethics gendered?\u00a0 How does feminist perspective contribute to understanding the pluralism of bioethics?\u00a0\u00a0 8.\u00a0Living in a pluralistic world of bioethics: Perspectives vs foundational approach to bioethics.\u00a0Monism vs. Pluralism: why we need to approach bioethics in a pluralistic manner? The limitations of monistic approach to bioethics. Why and how we should approach bioethics using different perspectives and lenses. \u00a0 Tutorials:\u00a0 1.\u00a0Decision-making in healthcare settings (with simulation exercise):\u00a0An introduction to how the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice are relevant and featured in healthcare scenarios. Identify the moral dilemmas in the scenarios, and reflect on the rationale behind the decisions.\u00a0 2.\u00a0Moral decision-making of life and death matters (with simulation exercise to inform AI decision making):\u00a0Moral Machine Exercise of Automated Car. Identify and reflect on feelings, sentiments as well as reasoning that go into the decision-making process. Recognize personal values and what shape one\u2019s moral decision regarding life and death matters. 3.\u00a0Case study: Bringing it all together:\u00a0Use case study to illustrate how a pluralistic approach to bioethics works. \u00a0 Glossary/Notes:  Care ethics: How about the genuine care and concerns for other people and living beings?  Feminist ethics: Can we treat the moral theories available not as foundations but different perspectives?\u00a0\u00a0  Minority ethics: What about the moral concerns of the minority?  Narrative ethics: How about the stories and experiences behind people\u2019s decisions?\u00a0  Principlism: Moral theories that are based on one single principle seems to be too narrow\u2026 how about one that has four?  Trolleyology: stems from the \u201ctrolley problem\u201d or \u201ctrolley dilemma\u201d invented by the contemporary British philosopher Phillipa Foot in defending the doctrine of double effect (the morality of killing to save the life of others). Trolleyology is an evolved version of the trolley problem with scenarios that trigger different moral considerations behind judgment and a chosen action.

However, the humanities have the potential to help us understand and transform how we view and relate to the natural world. This course explores environmental issues from an interdisciplinary perspective integrating philosophy and the arts.The first part of the course addresses central issues in environmental philosophy and ethics. We will examine (a) the concepts of nature and environment; (b) the relationship between the human being and its environment, between culture and nature; and (c) the Anthropocene, the geological epoch in which human activity is the primary factor shaping environmental change. We then turn to environmental ethics, asking what moral responsibilities we have to non-human living beings and ecosystems. We conclude the first part of the course with a discussion of the aesthetic value of nature. In the second part of the course, we will examine the role of the arts (especially literature, visual art, and film) in shaping our relationship with the natural world and motivating climate action. We will apply concepts from environmental philosophy and humanities to develop a deeper appreciation and critical understanding of environmental artworks, with a focus on work from Hong Kong artists. Throughout the course, experiential learning activities will give students the chance to see how transforming our understanding and relationship with nature can improve our overall well-being.This course bears on several of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will see how work in the humanities and arts can motivate climate action (SDG#13 Climate Action). By reimagining our relationship with the environment and the connections between nature and culture, we can envision more sustainable ways of life in a heavily urbanized space like Hong Kong (SDG#11 Sustainable Cities and Communities). And by transforming our attitude towards and relationship with nature, we enjoy the mental health benefits of a deepened appreciation of and connection with nature (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being).

Selected references in sociology, psychology, religion and literature will be introduced to provide a board intellectual perspective to understand the complex relationships between self and society. Students are expected to acquire an ability to analyze and critique on how different social institutions such as education, religion, family, media, work, consumerism, state, etc., affect our attitude and behaviors in some essential issues of life such as mate choice. Following the tradition of critical theory, this course assumes that this reflection is the first step for liberating from \"bad faith\" and living an authentic life. Through reflection on experience that affects them most, students are encouraged to critically examine sustainability issues concerning the well-beings of young people (topic 1, 2, 3 and SDG3), quality of education (topic 4 and SDG4), sustainability in the workplace (topic 5 and SDG8) and inequalities in the local context (topic 3, 4, 5 and SDG10).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2980", "title": "Meanings of Life", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGED2980 is double-coded with ANTH2350. \nNot for Anthropology Majors; and students who have taken ANTH2350.\nCo-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "(UGED2980 is double-coded with ANTH2350.)

Institutions such as lineage and family, marriage, religion, medical practices, art, education and politics shape our life patterns as well as social mores. Gender, as one of the building blocks of society and culture, shapes our values and is deeply embedded in our daily lives, and it weaves an intricate ideological fabric that strongly impacts our thoughts, feelings and action.  Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Students reflect on their various values and concepts in daily life through this course, and become a global citizen with an open mind.", "outcome": "(1)

In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of \u2018collective memory\u2019 of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of \u2018the past\u2019. This act of remembering and exploring \u2018our history\u2019 questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity \u2014 personal, collective, and spatial \u2014 in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong\u2019s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites\u2019 households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women\u2019s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": " It is anticipated that on completing the course, students will be able to:  \u00a0 \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 identify major areas and topics regarding the study of women\u2019s lives and experiences in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 analyse and discuss in what ways gender has been an organizing force in shaping families, professions, education, and social movements in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 examine one\u2019s self identity in complex historical and social contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 evaluate competing narratives of a \u2018Hong Kong Story\u2019 from a gender and historical perspective  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 apply first-hand knowledge and skills in writing history relating the personal to the social, cultural, political and economic contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 recognize the interconnections between different sources of inequality and oppression \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0critically engage with notions of social justice and social transformation  \u00a0  \u00a0", "syllabus": "\u00a0A\u00a0 INTRODUCTION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Introduction: Revisiting Hong Kong\u2019s history (1840s -1990s) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 Methodology: Narrative, Auto/biography and Oral HistoryB\u00a0 WOMEN IN THE FAMILY: Servitude, Lineage, and Family Networks in pre-war Hong Kong\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 Protected Women, san po tsai, mui tsai and concubines \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4 Village women and boat women\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5 Merchants\u2019 daughters: women in the elite families \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C\u00a0 WOMEN AND FEMALE EDUCATION : From Protection to Modernisation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 European missionaries and nuns\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7 Local headmistresses and teachers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8 Girls going to school and universityD\u00a0 WOMEN AT WORK: Gender, Work and Professions\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9 Brothel keepers and prostitutes in the 19th Century\u00a0\u00a0 10 Nurses and doctors (1920s-1980s)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 11 Factory workers (1960s-1990s)\u00a0E\u00a0 WOMEN IN PHILANTHROPY AND SOCIAL ACTIVISM (1910s-1970s): Public Voice for the Private Sphere\u00a0\u00a0 12 Leaders of the anti-mui tsai campaign, the campaign against licensed prostitution, the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YWCA and the Family Planning Association", "required_readings": "Primary SourcesSelected documents from archives of mission societies, girls\u2019 schools, and charities.Published Secondary SourcesHong Kong History and Women\u2019s HistoryNgo, Tak-wing (ed.)

This course reviews basic concepts, theories and research findings of romantic love and intimate relationship. Various aspects of romantic love and intimate relationship will be critically reviewed. Based on research from a wide range of disciplines including gender studies, cultural studies, sociology, psychology, counselling, media studies, among various fields, together with input from literature and popular culture, the course will cover major areas such as the following: how do we understand the notions of \u201clove\u201d and \u201cintimacy\u201d in the different social and personal contexts, what are the different stages in a relationship; the influence of cultural myths and social scripts; interpersonal processes within romantic relationships (such as attraction, social cognition, communication and conflicts, etc.); how social gender role shapes romantic feelings and behaviors; notions of equality and freedom within relationships; power and violence; intimate relationship across life span, etc. Students are encouraged to actively reflect upon their own life experience, to engage in critical discussions of cultural phenomenon through case studies, and learn to untangle the cultural myths, norms, and stereotypes that shapes our private lives and our society in general. Upon the completion of the course, students should demonstrate basic understanding of structure, functions, dynamics, and development of romantic love and other interpersonal relationship. The personal is political. As personal relationships are the most basic social relationships that makes up the larger network of social relationships, it is hope that students could use knowledge from this course as an insight to understand, develop, and improve the quality of their own interpersonal relationship, and would aspire to build a more open and equal society starting from equalitarian and mindful personal relationships.

Increasingly uneven and intensified processes of urbanization simultaneously generate serious challenges and exciting opportunities for urban populations across the globe. Contemporary cities are as much spaces of resonance, innovation, and emancipation as sites of violence, pollution, and alienation. This course revolves around the distinctive rhythms, experiences, and dynamics of urban life. What gives urban living its distinct characteristics? What current social, economic, and political problems deserve the attention of urban inhabitants? Which issues generate the greatest discord and motivate full coordination among different actors involved in governing cities? As urban life is characterized by both cosmopolitan conviviality and immense inequality, in this course students will learn about different modes of coexistence and exclusion in contemporary cities. Globalizing forms of urban protest arising from struggles over urban resources, space, and decision-making mechanisms will be investigated.

In this course, we will explore how to use different modes and genres of writing to effect environmental change. We will first examine the major elements of environmental writing through the exploration of different modes and genres, including children\u2019s books, blogs, essays, poetry, songs, social media, Apps, newspaper articles, and posters. We will then examine the major environmental issues we are facing globally and in Hong Kong, and examine how environmental writing is currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and effect change. We will also investigate public awareness of the major environmental issues facing Hong Kong, to develop an understanding of how we can engage the public more effectively through writing.
