Granting an opportunity to grasp the development of the Philippines under Spanish, American, and Japanese colonial rule, the course places attention upon the nation\u2019s capital city, Manila, a place where life has also been historically shaped by Chinese, Japanese, Western, and native cultural influences. Focusing on elements of cultural, political, and urban history the course endeavours to explain how \u2018the Philippine nation\u2019 has historically unfolded, and why Manila, today a metropolis with a population in excess of 13 million people, has come to play such a dominant role in determining the nature of Philippine society prior to the country being granted independence in 1946. Utilizing innovative teaching methods to enable students to critically understand the physical as well as cultural character of the city, and so the nation at large, a multidisciplinary approach is fostered so as to encourage learners to recognize and explain factors that have influenced Philippines civilization as it progressed from the \u201ctraditional\u201d to the \u201cmodern\u201d. Encouraging learners too to identify connections between the country and places elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, ultimately the course places the evolution of life in the Philippine Archipelago within the greater Asia-Pacific region. Accordingly, the curriculum is cut into two distinct sections: The Philippines pre-1898; and, the Philippines post-1898.

This comparative studies programme shall allow students to obtain a critical understanding of the nature of industrial society through fostering a multidisciplinary approach to industrialisation and many of the changes in society it helped to establish. The course will give students the opportunity to consider the ideas and the conditions in Europe and elsewhere that produced industrial change, capitalism and democracy \u2013 processes that the West considered then and still considers today as desirable for itself and other parts of the world. The curriculum gives particular focus to pre-industrial Europe and its economy, industrial Britain, urbanisation and its effects upon social classes, public health, housing and ways of living. The course is designed to build skills such as thinking critically, well-constructed writing and the clear presenting of oral arguments. In so doing students will be expected to critically engage with a range of academic disciplines such as History (social and economic, cultural and urban), Social Studies, Economics and Geography, so as to answer questions such as:\u2022 In what ways did industrialisation fundamentally change societies?\u2022 What factors accounted for the beginning of the Industrial Revolution?\u2022 How did patterns of urbanisation change as a consequence of industrial growth?\u2022 How did social class relations shift due to industrial progress?\u2022 How did industrial changes affect the role of women or children in the work place?\u2022 What demographic changes have occurred since industrialisation began?\u2022 Were the First and Second Industrial Revolutions the same or were they different?\u2022 How did rural developments affect the rise of industry in Europe\u2019s past?\u2022 What is the relationship between cities and the countryside both before and after the onset of industrial growth?\u2022 What dangers arise from industrial and urban transition?

Now President Chen Shui-bian wants to redefine Taiwan's status as a sovereign, independent country whose name is the Republic of China, while Beijing defines Taiwan as part of China. This course will examine the stand taken on Taiwan by key international actors, in particular the United States, but including Japan and the European Union. It will look at the Taiwan Straits military crises of the 1950s and the role of the United States, the initial strong international support for the KMT government as the sole legal government of all China until the tide turned in 1971, with Beijing replacing Taipei in the United Nations.

This era saw great changes of social and political theory: a ritual life that had reached from emperor into villages came to be articulated in relation to a central government and its cities. The rural population ceased to be central to ritual life and came to be marginalized. Orthodox values came to be looked upon as superstition. Meanwhile, a social ethos came to represent the fashion of a new age, and city life was looked upon as a symbol of progress. This transition from old to new repositioned the individual, family, nation, and even language and gender. This transition has continued to the present day, making us as much its creator as well as its product. This course seeks to raise questions about the society which we take for granted and in which we are now placed has evolved from the late Qing.", "outcome": "1.

It focuses on the forces that have led to the development of cities in the past, and achieves this through the lens of a multi-disciplinary perspective and the utilisation of various methodologies. Such a standpoint is adopted in order to allow for the exploration of the impacts of matters like politics, economics, culture and identity, art and architecture, intellectual thought, law, transportation, and military technology upon urban society at different times in history, and to recognise how they influenced the design and shape of the built environment, and so city living. Central to the programme is the use of comparative analyses which assist in identifying and contrasting patterns of urban change. As such differences in urban design that became evident in the past will be made clear. Furthermore such an approach helps illuminate and clarify the imprint upon urban space and the urban mind of agents affecting the urban development process, including visions and concepts (built and unbuilt) that have swayed social development. Importantly too in utilising this analytical perspective students are granted opportunities to test hypotheses under the guidance of their teacher about the causes and effects of urban transition, in so doing helping explicitly comprehend the narrative of historical urban development in both factual and conceptual terms.", "outcome": "1.
