We start the course by introducing the problem-solving paradigm with deep learning: data preparation, building the model, training the model, model evaluation, and hyper-parameter searching. Then, we fill in the details in the paradigm. Regarding the deep learning models, we will go from the simplest linear regression model, towards the relatively complicated models. To handle various data types, that is, the structured data, images, text, sequences, signals, and graphs, in our daily life, we would cover CNN/ResNet, RNN/LSTM, Attention, and GNN models. In addition to the above paradigms, we will also cover the commonly used techniques to handle overfitting. We would briefly go through the generative models, VAE, and GAN, at the end of this course.Advisory: Students are expected to have background knowledge on python programming.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4998", "title": "Final Year Project I", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Project", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Computer Sci & Engg", "requirements": "", "description": "The course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to carry out, under the supervision of an academic staff, an independent project with research elements in artificial intelligence topics.", "outcome": "1) Be able to identify and have a basic understanding of the literature related to the project topic.\u00a02) Be able to define and complete a project that utilizes results in the literature.\u00a03) Be able to perform a critical review of the project.\u00a04) Develop technical writing skills.", "syllabus": "The course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to carry out, under the supervision of an academic staff, an independent project with research elements in engineering.", "required_readings": "Literature review materials will be recommended by the project supervisor.", "recommended_readings": "", "terms": {"2024-25 Term 1": {"AAJ1-PRJ (7998)": {"startTimes": ["TBA"], "endTimes": ["TBA"], "days": ["TBA"], "locations": ["No Room Required"], "instructors": ["Professor YOUNG Fung Yu"], "meetingDates": ["02/09/2024 -
