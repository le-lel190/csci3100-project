This course talks about the characteristics and functioning of news, and its important role and functions in society. News is vital to us as it brings latest information of the day, helps create public opinion, educate our young generations, monitor the government and the powerful, as well as provide relaxation to our busy lives. To understand the news can essentially help us know our society. Various concepts and theories from the mass communication discipline are introduced together with some perspectives from other social sciences. Real-life examples from Hong Kong and abroad are analyzed.Students are first introduced to the unique nature of news and different types of news as found in both print and electronic media. Some new news formats, including free dailies, online newspapers, network social media and citizen journalism, are discussed in both international and local contexts. Relationships between journalism and closely related professions such as advertising and public relations are explicated in order to understand the actual functioning of news, as well as its impact on society. The professional concerns of the field of journalism and individual\u2019s news consumption habits are also highlighted in the course.After taking this course, students will be able to understand more about news and its relationship with the society.

The first part sets the stage by examining the relationship between news and society, the nature and characteristics of news, as well as inviting students to reflect on their news reading habits. The second part deals with various major types of news, including social news, political news, entertainment news, and international news. The third part is about some emerging news trends in society, including the rapid rise of free newspapers, online newspapers and the new social network media as news channels. The final part discusses institutional relationships among news, advertising, public relations, and other social sectors. The reflection on journalistic professionalism and media ethics serve to round up and highlight the role and responsibilities of news in society.\u00a0The following is an outline of this course:\u00a0Week 1\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: News and SocietyThe course starts by introducing the role of journalism as a vital social institution and its unique function as the often-quoted \"fourth estate\" of the government. But in fact news serves to monitor the government and the society, and thus freedom of the press is important not only to the journalists but to the general public. Contribution of newswork to the proper maintenance of the public sphere and establishment of a civil society is emphasized.\u00a0Key concepts: journalism as social institution, journalism as the fourth estate, press freedom, public sphere\u00a0Week 2\u00a0\u00a0 What is News: Characteristics and PerspectivesNews is a complex social phenomenon. It is so familiar to us but yet a simple and clear definition cannot be satisfactorily reached among academics and practitioners. Many agree that \"immediacy\", \"importance\" and \"interest\" are the three most important components. Others see news as some sort of deviant events. Some scholars regard news as vital social information while others think of it as a commercial product. Objectivity can be regarded as a noble ideal but some say it is a \"strategic ritual\". Scholars from the humanistic tradition would treat it primarily as a \"speech act\".\u00a0Key concepts: definitions of news, the three \u201cIs\u201d of news, news as deviance, objectivity as strategic ritual, news net, humanistic perspectives of news\u00a0Week 3\u00a0\u00a0 Cultivating Good News Reading HabitsNews consumption patterns were stable in the past but are now showing great changes due to the coming of the Internet age. People tend to read less print newspapers and spend more time getting information online. This is especially true for the younger generations who practically grow up together with the Internet. How can we instill the value of news reading to the young people? How can they become smarter readers, no matter which news venues/channels they tune to? New technologies are a threat to existing media but they also open up new opportunities and possibilities. It is essential for our students to be news literate in order to become an informed and critical citizen.\u00a0Key concepts: changing news use patterns, news consumer, critical citizenship, media education, technological impact\u00a0Week 4\u00a0\u00a0 Social News: Taste Strata of Mass and EliteNews about the society can vary according to the orientations of news organizations and the tastes of the reading/viewing public. The elite class has different taste preference over news when compared with the mass public. Fierce competition and marketization have driven many news organizations to go down the road of tabloidization and McDonaldization. They tend to hype the news and respond more to market \"wants\" instead of social \"needs\".\u00a0Key concepts: tabloidization, McDonaldization, market driven-journalism, hyping\u00a0Week 5\u00a0\u00a0 Political News: Monitoring Those in PowerNews is always intertwined with the government, politicians and those who have power in society. Various political forces want to control or influence the press in order to gain advantages. They feed and spin stories to the media, which on the other hand try to play the watchdog function and report news responsibly. News coverage in election settings will be examined to see how journalists and politicians interact with each other, and whether the public is properly informed.\u00a0Key concepts: spin doctoring, watchdog function, social responsibility theory, media and election, stereotyping\u00a0Week 6\u00a0\u00a0 Entertainment News: \"Interesting\", Not \"Public Interest\" Some people love entertainment news. They are keen on the \"interesting\" acts of or self-directed promotion by certain celebrities and have little concern over \"public interest\". As a result, entertainment news tends to be trivial or muckraking. The paparazzi teams sent by news organizations could not care less about invasion of privacy or damaging celebrities' reputations. The blurring of boundaries (between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, public and private, etc.) is something we should be aware of when reading this type of news.\u00a0Key concepts: trivialization, paparazzi, personal muckraking, blurring of boundaries, invasion of privacy\u00a0Week 7\u00a0\u00a0 International News: Our Window on the WorldThe course will talk about international news as the world is getting more and more global and integrated. It is essentially our window to look at the world outside. Between nations, diplomacy is often done through news reporting, which significantly reflects national interests. The major international news agencies play an important role. Journalists usually try hard to \"domesticate\" foreign news to make it more attractive to local audience.\u00a0Key concepts: media and national interest, public policy, media diplomacy, domestication of news\u00a0Week 8\u00a0\u00a0 Free Newspapers: The New Model That WorksTraditionally, TV is free but newspaper is paid. But in the past few decades, paid TV channels have quickly emerged as well as free newspapers. Print newspapers rely on both advertising and subscription or single copy sales. This business model is upset by the free newspapers which rely solely on advertising. People find that being free is irresistible, and they are less concerned about the quantity and quality of news as long as it is free of charge. What are the implications for the future of journalism? Would it popularize newspaper reading or downgrade the quality of journalism, or both? How do free dailies, paid dailies and online dailies interact? These are evolving issues worthy of closer examination.\u00a0Key concepts: distribution-driven journalism, free vs. paid, Metro Daily formula, work-habitation patterns, interactions among different types of newspapers\u00a0Week 9\u00a0\u00a0 Online Newspapers: News in the Internet AgeGoing online is a relatively new phenomenon for the press starting in the mid-1990s. It began as a low-cost spin-off that carried big promises both in terms of revenue and readership. The actual result favors the latter but not the former, and the journalism industry is still seeking a workable business model for online newspapers. But onlineDailies do revolutionize news delivery and its content because of its electronic and digital format. A new marketplace is forged but its potential has not been fully realized. Whether online newspapers would eventually replace the print versions remains an intriguing question for both the academics and the practitioners.\u00a0Key concepts: electronic marketplace, information marketplace, opinion marketplace, virtual media space, media format\u00a0Week 10 Social Network Media as News ChannelsIn the past decade, new social network media have become so popular that they also begin to act as news source and serve as a platform for news dissemination. What are their relationships with traditional news organizations? How do they affect the nature, delivery and quality of news? Scholars differentiate the role of traditional journalists as \"gatekeeping\" from the new role of online journalists as \"gatewatching\". Is citizen journalism in the Internet age a blessing or a curse? Would there be generational differences? All these questions will be explored in the course.\u00a0Key concepts: alternative media, Facebook, Twitter, blogging, citizen journalism, gatekeeping, gatewatching\u00a0Week 11\u00a0News and Advertising: Any Strings Attached with the Money?News and advertising seem to be inseparable worldwide. Journalists work together with advertising and marketing people to bring both news and product information to the readers/audiences. But the journalistic side and the market side of a news organization have different and even opposing ideals and goals. They are in constant battle but have to rely on the other for survival. How can news be immune from unwanted advertising influence? Why is public broadcasting possible but not public print journalism?\u00a0Key concepts: journalistic theory vs. market theory, theory of low involvement, types of advertising, commercialization, sponsorship \u00a0Week 12 News and Public Relations: How to Influence the PressJournalists and public relations people constitute another pair of actors in constant tension and cooperation. Journalists need news sources and public relations practitioners provide news and information to news organizations. But public relations people are often accused of staging pseudo-events in order to gain publicity and propaganda. They try to influence the press and get coverage. In recent years, many journalists leave the profession and join the public relations field as they know how news work and how to gain press coverage. It is an interesting topic and has major implications for the content and quality of news reporting.\u00a0Key concepts: pseudo-events, staging, manufacturing consent, propaganda model\u00a0Week 13 Rethinking News: Professionalism, Ethics, and AlternativesThis week is a wrap-up of the course by focusing on media professionalism and ethics. How can journalists do their job properly under all sorts of constraints? Can they adhere to a high standard of media ethics? Can news reflects different perspectives and interests in the society? Is the noble ideal of public journalism a viable alternative? How can news better serve our society and the general public? It is hoped that students will be able to reflect on these questions through the readings and the various assignments in this course.\u00a0Key concepts: journalistic professionalism, media ethics, multi-perspectival news, public journalism ", "required_readings": "Required readings:Week 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: News and SocietyWerner, W., & Nixon, K.

With the advent of the new media technology, new forms of organizational crisis emerge. They are called Internet-mediated crises. A major difference between the Internet-mediated crises and the traditional crises lies in the intensive interactivity, collectivity, simultaneity and dialogic sphericity of the former. This very nature of Internet-mediated crisis makes it all the more hard to handle. A specialized and critical function of the public relations practice is the management of crisis. This course covers two major levels. The first level takes on a functionalism approach to crisis management. The second level takes on a more critical approach in public relations. Students will learn how crisis reflects complicity and dynamism between citizens and organizations in modern societies. They will acquire an enhanced appreciation of communication that can be brought to bear in such crisis situations and a greater familiarity with the interactivity of an organization and its stakeholders as well as the environments in times of crises. They will also gain more sensitivity in public demands of socially responsible practices in the business contexts.", "outcome": " \u00a0 Upon successful completion of this course, students are expected to acquire the following outcomes: \u00a0 Remembering: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The characteristics of an organizational crisis; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The types of crisis in modern societies; Understanding \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A full understanding of the consequence a crisis can have on the reputation and\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 success of businesses and organizations; Analyzing and applying \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ability to identify key messages, formulate appropriate responses and utilize\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 practical techniques to communicate with stakeholders about crisis situations; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Skills necessary to address the issues when a crisis situation demands immediate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 public response; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Understanding of the dynamics and implications of various public relations \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 strategies; \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mastery of relevant theories, as well as practical techniques and planning \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 necessary to successfully communicate before, during and after a crisis situation. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Understanding how the Internet has facilitated the rising collective power of\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 consumers\u00a0 and commercial democracy in modern societies.

Several crisis and non-crisis cases will be used for comparisons and discussions. At the end of the class, the students should be able to grasp the core characteristics of a crisis and the types of crisis commonly occurred in modern societies. Key concepts: Crisis vs. problem, types of crisis, crisis impacts \u00a0 Week 2 The stakeholder theory and the four models of public relations \u00a0 The class teaches Freeman (1984)\u2019s stakeholder theory. It proffers the students an overview of the scope of the stakeholder groups that an organization may need to handle in crisis communication and communication. It then introduces Grunig and Hunt\u2019s (1984) four models of public relations to give students a framework in viewing the relationships between organizations and stakeholders. Consequences of ignoring these relationships will be examined through the use of real crisis cases. Key concepts: The stakeholder theory, four models of public relations \u00a0 \u00a0 Week 3 The public, the media and the new media \u00a0 The class examines the evolution of the public demand and expectation on organizations in general and in times of crisis. The role of the media in shaping public opinion in crisis is also discussed. It also examines the impact of the advent of the new media technology on crisis communication and management. Online public forums on crisis cases will be studied. Key concepts: The critical mass, the media, the new media, the social media \u00a0 Week 4 Blog-related crisis in modern societies. \u00a0 Blog-related crises include crises initiated or facilitated by personal blogs. The class examines rumor and fact types of blog-related crises. To demonstrate, several recent examples are used illustrate the huge impact of public comments on blogs. Factors that contribute to effective blog-related crisis management are discussed. Key concepts: blogs, word-of-mouth and blogosphere \u00a0 \u00a0 Week 5\u00a0 and 6 Pre-crisis planning \u00a0 The class teaches a crucial stage in crisis management: Pre-crisis alert and planning. A good pre-crisis preparation may save an organization from a crisis. As such, students will be taught risk assessment, early detection and planning in the pre-crisis stage. Organizational structures and cultures that facilitate down-up reporting are necessary in early detection. Organizations that are particularly prone to crisis will be discussed. The importance of pre-crisis detection on the Internet and tools for monitoring will also be discussed. Key concepts: pre-crisis stage, crisis planning, risk assessment, organizational structures, organizational cultures \u00a0 Week 7 and 8 Crisis communication and management \u00a0 Benoit\u2019s (1995) image restoration theory and Coombs\u2019 (1999) on-going crisis theory will be used to build theoretical frameworks in conceptualizing crisis communication and management. The class also examines the principles in making news to give students some guidelines about what to say and do in times of crisis, especially upon media enquiry. Good and bad examples of crisis communication management will be used for comparison and contrast. Key concepts: crisis communication and management, image restoration theory, ongoing crisis, the making of news \u00a0 Week 9 and 10 Post-crisis communication \u00a0 Post-crisis communication is as important as crisis management because it determines how successful an organization is in restoring its image and reputation. It examines what is needed to be done for an organization to rebuild the lost trust. Several crisis cases will be used to investigate this topic. The students will explore on what constitutes a good post-crisis communication in this post-modern era. Key concepts: post-crisis communication \u00a0 Week 11 Guest speaker \u00a0 An expert in crisis communication and management will be invited to give a talk to students. \u00a0 Week 12 and 13 Corporate social responsibility, sustainability and crisis \u00a0 The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) will be introduced. Cases showing the increased public demand on corporate social responsibility will be presented. The evolution of the concepts of CSR will also be discussed. The class will then examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility and pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis management.

SUBLIMINAL PERSUASION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Week 1: Subliminal Messaging and Materialism \u00a0 This week will introduce briefly all three sections and emphasis more specifically on subliminal persuasion, using materialism, luxury branding in China as examples. China has replaced Japan as the second strongest economic power in the world in 2012. It has also surpassed the US to become the second largest luxury brand market in 2009, spending of $9.4 billion and accounting for 27.5% of total global sales of luxury brands in the world. The invasion of luxury brands will inevitably alter the spending culture in China. Luxury brand ads hint subtly that consumers using them belong to a higher social group in the society. Students will discuss the subliminal indicators of luxury brand ads and their effects on attitudes towards social status in the society.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 2: Commercialization of Friendship in Social Networking Sites \u00a0 Social networking sites are dominating the media landscape among young people. Many viral ads are circulated through the disguise of sincere recommendations from friends, who actually share information for an incentive. This class will look into the core of this issue: should friendship be commercialized for personal gains? \u00a0 Week 3: Properties, Personal Loan Ads and Wealth \u00a0 The recent waves of glamorized Hong Kong properties ads disseminated in China led to grave consequences in raising the prices of flats in Hong Kong. The property ads In Hong Kong shape unrealistic desires in viewers to own a flat that demands a lifetime of hard earned salaries. Personal loan ads encourage a supposedly free life of spending with no responsibility. This lesson will discuss the dynamics of these subliminal messages in affecting one\u2019s decision about how to spend his / her money. \u00a0 Week 4: Political Campaigns and Elections \u00a0 The presence of political campaigns in commercial media becomes prevalent these days due to the rise of democratization in the election process. This lesson will look into the various tactics and subliminal strategies used and manipulated in political advertising and its effects on public participation in election. \u00a0 II. MEDIATION OF REALITY \u00a0 Week 5: Beauty Ads and Body Image \u00a0 This lesson will start with an in-depth look at the concept of mediation of reality, using studies conducted in Hong Kong that relate beauty and slimming product / service ads to a negative self-perceived body image in both men and women. Teenagers, in particular, are finding their self in their growing years by comparing themselves to the models in the ads. The gap between the idealized self and actual self creates frustrations among many. To bridge the gap, some fall for crash diets and some for desperate acts of plastic surgeries. \u00a0 Week 6: Stereotypical Sex Ads and Gender Roles \u00a0 This lesson looks into the relationship between commoditization and objectification of the body and the resultant stereotypical roles played by men and women. Students will be challenged to live beyond the fixed roles narrowly defined and presented in the pseudo-reality. \u00a0 Week 7: Tutor King / Queen Ads and Education \u00a0 The educational system in Hong Kong requires students to acquire incessant training and upgrading. Many tutors chanced this opportunity to create fast track learning to success by advertising their success rate of getting a student to obtain an As. This form of promotion alters students\u2019 mentality to learning. Tutors acting as opinion leaders in ads create a trend of commercialized education. \u00a0 Week 8: A \u201cCopycat\u201d Culture \u00a0 \u201cCopycat\u201d China refers not only to the many cases of copying of products but also the imitation of ideas and other intellectual properties in China. Advertising is an industry that is keen on creativity, the very core element that sustains the industry. Piracy will suffocate the creative industry in the long run. Students will scan the creative landscape in China and learn to identify the seemingly original creative reality. \u00a0 III. INFUSION OF CONSTRUCTED MEANINGS \u00a0 Week 9: Freedom of Speech and the Press  This class will start examining the idea about meaning and value driven advertising/ advocacy. Recent cases show that advertising is affecting the press in Hong Kong and the Mainland has been censoring a lot of ads online and outdoor. What is the value of commercial speech? How much would the commercial speech be compromised? Will the censorship erode creativity, global branding strategy and business development? Students will investigate the longstanding struggle of the protection of speech in Hong Kong and the mainland. \u00a0 Week 10: Globalizing and Standardization \u00a0 Global brands launched by global advertising agencies bring about their unique culture from the country-of-origin into a foreign country. For a global brand to be successfully adopted by local citizens, the agencies need to accommodate the traditional culture. However, the global influence for standardization sometimes surpasses localization, resulting in a pervasive infusion of foreign values. The balance and consideration of both cultures are the center of discussion in this lesson. A few global campaigns around the world will be presented to demonstrate the delicate balance between globalization and localization. \u00a0 Week 11: \u201cAnti\u201d Campaigns and Social Movements \u00a0 This lesson will look into the value-driven impact and of Public Service Announcements (PSAs), including the anti-smoking, anti-drug and anti-AIDS campaigns on society. The lesson will also focus on the development, planning and execution of those campaigns. It is the purpose of the lesson to raise the awareness of the students in these cause advertising campaigns. \u00a0 Week 12: Earth Hour, Outdoor Light Pollution and other Green Campaigns \u00a0 Greenpeace and other environmental protection groups have been working on major campaigns to improve the living conditions of the world. A few successful green campaigns will be discussed in class to reveal their value shifting strategies. \u00a0 Week 13: Food, Drug Ads and Public Health \u00a0 World Health Organization has established the strong tie between advertising of high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) food and obesity. While UK has exercised blanket ban of food advertising to children and many other countries following suit, the Broadcasting Authority in Hong Kong has only advised five cases in the past four years regarding HFSS food ads to children. This lesson will investigate the difficult path to policy change in the business sector in Hong Kong. Advertising of all medicinal products in Hong Kong is strictly controlled by the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap 231) (the UMAO). Section 3 of the UMAO provides for an outright prohibition against the publication of 'any advertisement likely to lead to the use of any medicine \u2026 for the purpose of treating \u2026 or preventing' any disease, disorder or abnormal physical state.

We will review and discuss how various factors have contributed to the invention and development of communication fads. \u00a0 Week 3 Mediated memories: How we remember and are remembered? Communication technologies have been important memory devices in human history. We will trace how communication technologies co-evolved with memory practices. \u00a0 Week 4 Social media: How we connect and are connected? What media are not \u201csocial media\u201d? Media always facilitate networking in different forms. We will reconsider what differentiates the social media we know of today from previous generations of social media. \u00a0 Week 5 Dating apps and romance  The meanings of \u2018romance\u2019 and \u2018intimacy\u2019 have undergone sweeping changes with the advent of dating apps in smartphones. In this class, we will examine the features of these apps and uncover their assumptions underlying \u2018love\u2019. \u00a0 Week 6 MOOC and learning  Massive Open Online Courses are introducing new forms of teaching, learning and academic accreditation. In a broader sense, how has Internet transformed learning? We will critically evaluate some popular claims in this aspect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 7 KOL and public opinions Key Opinion Leaders are also known as social influencers or sometimes internet celebrities. They are seen to exert increasing influence in \u2018public opinions\u2019 or \u2018public sentiments\u2019.\u3000In this class, we will revisit earlier communication theory regarding two-step flow of information and see how Internet has brought new practices in shaping public opinions.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 8 Streaming media and entertainment  In this class, we will focus on the case of streaming media and discuss how entertainment is changed in the Internet era. We will also consider how this in turn affects the production, distribution and consumption of media products. \u00a0 Week 9 - 10 Haters and comment culture Comment culture is a notable Internet phenomenon. Instead of looking at \u2018likes\u2019, we focus on the mechanisms behind \u2018dislikes\u2019 and the behaviors of \u2018haters\u2019.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 11 Protest mobilization and social movements Internet is seen to be a key factor in protest mobilization. We will examine some key elements in social movements and discuss how social media, for example, have contributed (or not) in the mobilization process.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 12 Surveillance and sensor society  The classic \u2018big brother\u2019 thesis is discussed with a careful consideration of many emerging practices in surveillance and self-surveillance. The idea of \u2018sensor society\u2019 will be introduced to see how we are (in)voluntarily contributing to a productive surveillance culture.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 13 Hello future!  In this final class, we will reconsider the two central themes of convergence and participation and make both informed and wild guesses for the future. \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " Week 1 Phenomena, problems and issues \u00a0 Jenkins, H.

The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge regarding the ten questions to be asked and answered in the course.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following is an outline of the course:(1) Introduction: The formation of Hong Kong Culture, a historical overviewThe lecture will trace the formation and changes of Hong Kong culture from the 1950s to the 2010s, relating social changes to the cultural changes of audio-visual texts produced in different periods of time. Key concepts will be introduced to help students make sense of cultural patterns as articulated in movies and television programs. Key concepts: textuality, contextuality, media representations(2) The Birth of Hong Kong ManThe lecture will focus on the cultural differentiations of mainlanders and Hongkongers in the 1970s. Students will think about the question of why Hong Kong people, mostly ethnic Chinese, saw themselves as a rather different social group of their own. A few classic texts will be used to illustrate the logic of \"othering\" and stigmatizing mainlanders.Key concepts: \"other\", cultural imaginations, stigma(3) New Wave Film and Colonial PoliticsThe lecture will introduce some basic concepts of colonialism. Some mainstream texts will be contrasted with some new wave movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some patterns of colonial articulations and de-articulations will be illustrated by these mainstream and new wave productions.Key concepts: colonialism, marginality(4) Political Metaphors in TV and FilmThe lecture will explain the reasons why there were quite of lot of political metaphors in television and films produced in the 1990s. The relations between political censorship, social anxiety and polysemic articulations will be elaborated with significant cases.Key concepts: polysemy, metaphor, censorship(5) Nonsense and Nostalgia, Remembering and ForgettingThe lecture will explain the nature of mediated collective memories and the social functions they perform. The rise of nostalgic texts in the 1990s will be contrasted with the discourses of collective memories in the 2000s.Key concepts: nostalgia, collective memories(6) Urban Space & Postmodern City The lecture will trace the changes in urban representations in films and television from the 1980s up to recent years when discourses concerning urban developments and cultural preservations are competing for public attention.Key concepts: urban imaginations, postmodernity, space and place(7) Media Events: 1997 and 1st July The lecture will introduce the theory of \"media events\" and apply it to major turning points of Hong Kong society such as July 1st in 1997 and 2003, SARS, the Sichuan earthquake, etc. The changes of Hong Kong culture will be examined by looking into the configurations of major media events in recent years.Key concepts: media events, social movements(8) The Rise & Fall of the HK Middle Class The lecture will trace the \"middle class debate\" in the 1980s.

The course is developed and evolved around two major themes, namely mass media and gender. Using key concepts and theories in mass communication and cultural studies, it discusses the influences and power of mass media with an emphasis on gender-related issues. The latter are in turn related to other social and cultural phenomena that will bring in knowledge and perspectives from other disciplines (e.g. sociology and psychology). The course will examine several recurring controversies related to gender in mass media. These controversies range from representation of sex and gender in media, to the media portrayals of homosexuals and the treatment of taboos. The course will identify and discuss the many competing viewpoints, and the ensuing actions, held by different stakeholders, including media producers, social activists, government regulators, educators and the general audiences. Their implications to legislation and education will also be identified.Students will be able to describe the key characteristics of modern media, in particular their roles in the construction of gender identities and discourses about various gender issues.", "outcome": "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students will be able to describe key characteristics of mass media. \u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students will be able to discuss the influences and power of mass media in our society.\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students will be able to differentiate between such concepts as pornography and erotica, masculinity and femininity, etc.\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students will be able to discuss competing viewpoints about gender in the media.\u00a05.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students will be able to produce a media text that offers a critique to one of the issues covered in the course.", "syllabus": "The course will cover six recurring gender issues.\u00a0These issues are intentionally framed as debatable controversies.\u00a0At first glance, these controversies might stand as individual case studies that have little logical coherence.\u00a0However, they all address key concepts in mass communication and gender theories.\u00a0The class will study the roles of media in the production and propagation of these heated debates.\u00a0\u00a0 The class will also study the competing viewpoints, and their justifications, held by different stakeholders.
