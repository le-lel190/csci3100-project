In an era of globalization, the regional and national aspects of growth are continuously contested through both spatial (e.g. areas, their interactions and relationship with other areas) and aspatial (e.g. institutional and political factors) processes. This course will provide an overview of key economic-geographical theories and concepts in analyzing economic processes at various geographical scales. To this end, the relationships between space, economy and society will be discussed using a number of cases. Topics cover globalization and local development, and how they work together to shape spatial organization and economic change, location of production and transnational corporations, and spatial interaction and network.

Sustainable development is a global vision for the future. This approach to development should not only generate economic growth, but also distribute its benefits equitably, regenerate the environment rather than destroy it, as well as empower people rather than marginalize them. The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to \u201cinterlink and integrate\u201d Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development.", "outcome": " After successfully completing this course, the students will be able to:  Evaluate the conflicting views on the reasons for the lack of a more sustainable development;  Analyze where the solutions may lay for SDGs, and the economic, social and environmental constraints to the adoption of these solutions;  Students will be able to understand and describe cognitive, socio-economic and behavioural aspects of sustainable development, and  Comprehend the skills necessary to interpret the policies of governments and international organisations. \u00a0", "syllabus": " 1.

Our modern society is built on modern energy consumption patterns. However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. Accordingly, one critical goal of energy development is to maximize the positive impacts and to minimize the negative impacts of energy consumption. After discussing the role of energy consumption in a society, this course will analyze how energy consumption and the environment affect each other. Students will then be guided through various levels of a society, from individuals, households, communities, to cities, countries and the world in general discussion and case studies on how energy is consumed. Recognizing the importance of energy conservation as a key solution, this course will further examine two major barriers, particularly the behavior and efficiency gaps, to understand how we could achieve the goal.

Many geographic information system (GIS) related assignments are to produce maps, i.e. to present spatial data, process, and analytical results in form of map products. Cartographic knowledge and technique is a type of grammar that allows for the effective design and production of quality maps and other visual products. However, in recent decades, the process of map production is changing from supply to demand-driven and the function of maps emphasizes more on exploratory capability. Cartographers follow stipulated methods and techniques while incorporation of new ideas due to the emergent paradigm shift becomes equally important in map production. By adopting the five-step design thinking process, meaningful and innovative ideas can be generated in creating better maps for visual communication and exploration.This course introduces the principles of cartography and design thinking process. Fundamental concepts of cartography include map projection and conventional map design theories such as colour theory, symbolization and map design will be covered in the first part of the course. The design thinking process including empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test is introduced and practiced associated with a map-making problem that is going to be solved by students in group. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and interactive class activities. Lectures are designed to cover important theoretical concepts while the laboratories are implemented to provide students hands-on experience and skills on cartographic presentation and visualization using several software tools.

However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. On one hand, energy is a key foundation of our modern way of life. Electricity illuminates and operates the world. Modern transportation systems are energy intensive. The consumption of natural gas for cooking avoids indoor air pollution that is causing over one million premature deaths in poor countries. On the other hand, energy also creates many problems, such as air pollution, excessive water consumption and pollution, and most importantly, global climate change. Energy plays a crucial role in shaping the current global financial system through the petrodollar system, but also has frequently casted shadows on geopolitical and sometimes military conflicts. With a great majority of global CO2 emissions under national/regional carbon neutrality (or net zero) commitments, our utilization of energy resources will go through fundamental reforms. The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewables is exerting profound influences on economic development, technological transformation and geopolitical disputes. This course aims to guide students through a wide and interconnected array of real-world topics covering energy consumption, fossil fuels and non-fossil resources, and especially their impacts on and from carbon neutrality. Students are not required to have prior exposure to the field but should be open-minded in analyzing issues from alternative perspectives. The course will be taught from an interdisciplinary approach according to the nature of topics.", "outcome": "After taking this course, students are expected to be equipped with comprehensive knowledge on energy and carbon neutrality management. Intensive data will be employed in the lectures. Students should learn the skills to present and analyze quantitative data. The course will train the students to approach problems with independent thinking. All continents and major countries will be covered and compared on energy and the environment as well their associated financial and geopolitical issues. Students will leave with a global view.", "syllabus": "Weekly topics (course syllabus): \u00a01. Introduction to the topic and course overview\u00a0Concentration 1: Energy consumption\u00a02.

While the coverage is broad and comprehensive, emphasis will be placed on the two most prominent tools, i.e. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), in terms of their origins, legal and regulatory requirements, and practices around the world. After introducing the conceptual framework and theoretical foundation of environmental assessment, specific methods and techniques (both qualitative and quantitative) will be introduced for students to understand the procedures and systems and gain the technical skills for practical applications. Environmental planning considerations and impact assessment will be examined for different sectors (industry, commercial, transportation, etc.) and multiple environmental media (air, water, solid waste, and noise) at difference spatial scales (local, regional, and national).

However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. On one hand, energy is a key foundation of our modern way of life. Electricity illuminates and operates the world. Modern transportation systems are energy intensive. The consumption of natural gas for cooking avoids indoor air pollution that is causing over one million premature deaths in poor countries. On the other hand, energy also creates many problems, such as air pollution, excessive water consumption and pollution, and most importantly, global climate change. Energy plays a crucial role in shaping the current global financial system through the petrodollar system, but also has frequently casted shadows on geopolitical and sometimes military conflicts. With a great majority of global CO2 emissions under national/regional carbon neutrality (or net zero) commitments, our utilization of energy resources will go through fundamental reforms. The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewables is exerting profound influences on economic development, technological transformation and geopolitical disputes. This course aims to guide students through a wide and interconnected array of real-world topics covering energy consumption, fossil fuels and non-fossil resources, and especially their impacts on and from carbon neutrality.
