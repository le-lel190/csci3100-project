The course aims at revealing the fundamental role that physics principles have been playing in the development of science and technology (S&T), which has drastically changed our ways of living and understanding of nature. Successful stories on the evolution of S&T in human history are introduced in the perspectives of STEM, i.e., from the discovery of fundamental Scientific (Physics) (S) principles, to applying the principles to Technological (T) innovations, solving Engineering (E) problems to make the applications viable, and with Mathematics (M) as the essential language that encompasses the whole process. Modern technology is also shown to change the ways of modern scientific investigation and accelerate human understanding of the physical world in an unprecedented speed. Science related social issues are used to help students understand the importance of using science principles and knowledge in making judgements and informed decisions. Lively demonstrations, lab visit, and STEM activities are used in class to (1) illustrate basic physics principles, (2) make physics principles more connected to students\u2019 daily life applications, and (3) better prepare students for explaining science concepts and conducting basic educational STEM activities as an educator, publisher, reporter, and in other S&T related disciplines in the future. Secondary school physics are not required to take this course.", "outcome": " After completing the course, students should be able to:  Explain and apply some fundamental physics principles in non-technical terms.  Create, plan, and conduct basic STEM education activities related to physics and explain the underlying principles.  Explain and exemplify the interplay between science and technology, especially on how fundamental physics principles have evolved into innovative applications that changed the world, and how the advance in technology has accelerated our understanding of nature.  Recognize and appreciate the generality and beauty of physics principles and be aware of its working in nature, its impacts on technology and daily life.  Recognize and appreciate mathematics as the language of physical sciences and its fundamental role in all forms of engineering.  Analyze scientific information in public media and popular science contexts; and think critically on science related issues.  Make judgements and informed decisions based on science principles and knowledge.  Be motivated to learn about science and technology as a part of life-longed learning. \u00a0", "syllabus": " Major topics (nos. in [\u2026] refer to the references in Section 8):  Motions and Energy: Motion and inertia; Newton\u2019s second law of motion, friction, momentum, applications of these concepts on traffic and road safety; energy and power, and examples including chemical changes in digesting food and explosion; different sources of energy and their environmental impacts [1,2,4,5].\u00a0  Amazing Fluids: Basic introduction to the concepts of fluids such as density, pressure, viscosity, fluid resistance, diffusion and turbulence; basic principles of flying machines from frisbee to airplane; interactions of fluids with micro-particles, face masks and COVID-19 prevention [1,2,15].
