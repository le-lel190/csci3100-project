They are required to choose a subject for a paper, to create a logical structure, and to construct their own arguments academically. Their papers will be presented at the seminars.

Students\u2019 performances will be primarily assessed by their written papers and presentations, but also by their participation in the discussion session.

This learning process is totally dependent on students\u2019 own initiatives, creativity, sensitivity to theological and other issues, diligence, writing skills, as well as the awareness of self-limitations which can be reflected by their actively seeking advice from course instructors and through discussion with student peers.

It is a discourse which requires other discourses for its very possibility.\" In this light, theological study is inherently interdisciplinary. Also, theologians are increasingly getting involved in praxis, which calls for them to have the expertise to critically examine the social, cultural, and political dimensions of everyday life. This course addresses these two aspects of theological study and focuses on the various ways theology can engage with contemporary critical theories in order to theologically analyze a society along the three media of speech, money, and power, as described by J\u00fcrgen Habermas. The course selectively covers the following contemporary critical theories and topics: the Frankfurt School and Dialectical Thinking in the Marxist traditions; Michel Foucault's Theories of Power, Knowledge, Truth, Subjectivity, and Ethics; Postcolonialism and Decoloniality; Critical Theories of Everyday Resistance; Critical Historiography; Critical Theory; Feminism and Queer Theory. In addition to a survey of the various approaches to critical theories, selected prominent critical theorists from each approach will be discussed. The theological implications of these theories will be examined through the lens of selected social issues and phenomena. Students will be required to conduct a theologically critical analysis of selected issues in their home society by adopting one of the critical perspectives. This course weaves together analytical approaches from the two disciplines to provide a theologically critical understanding of contemporary social issues.", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course, students will acquire the ability to: understand the fundamentals of the methodology of critical theory, its historical trajectory, its relevance in the present day, and its theological implications in the study of society. utilize critical theory's tools to theologize how dominant social forces are manifesting in the world today. critically consider the possibilities and constraints of social progress from a theological perspective in the present day. conduct mini studies on pressing social issues, utilizing theological and critical perspectives from across disciplines.Students will develop the following skills: critical theological reasoning, especially concerning contemporary social issues. interdisciplinary skills required to analyse the world using theologically relevant critical theories.", "syllabus": "1.

In addition, contemporary theologians and church leaders share a growing concern for praxis that transforms the world and the church. All of this necessitates that theologians comprehend experience not only on a philosophical and conceptual level, but also as inherently concrete and social. Consequently, theologians are becoming increasingly interested in distinctive categories of empirical data pertinent to theology and in distinctive research methodologies pertinent to the analysis of these data. This is especially true of practical theologians and empirical theologians, though it is not exclusive to them. In this light, as stated by the editors of the Eerdmans series of Studies in Ecclesiology and Ethnography, if theology is to have impact on the church and world today, theologians must learn to utilize empirical research tools to provide more accurate, disciplined, and contextually-grounded research.This course thus exposes students to a variety of empirical research methods and data analytic tools that will help them understand, evaluate, and conduct empirical research relevant to theological studies. The primary emphasis will be on qualitative approaches, but students will also learn how to read quantitative research reports critically. It aims to provide students with a foundation for integrating theological inquiry and empirical research in a manner that not only maintains the integrity of both disciplines but also employs social scientific methods in a manner that is \"theological all the way through,\" as Helen Cameron has stated. Students will be required to conduct a mini-study on selected issues in their home society/church by adopting one of the empirical research methods.", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course, student should be able to: explain the role and importance\u00a0of empirical research in theology. exhibit a critical understanding of empirical research methods and their application to theological inquiry. explain why a particular empirical method is preferable for answering a particular theological research question. differentiate and explain various qualitative research methodologies. develop\u00a0open-ended questions for an in-depth oral interview and focus group interview. conduct qualitative data analysis manually and with software like NVivo.\u00a0 explain\u00a0the relationship between measurement and concept. critically comprehend basic\u00a0statistical language. explain which ethical considerations must be incorporated into empirical research. formulate a theological problem that is amenable to qualitative research and develop an appropriate research design. reflect theologically on empirical findings and incorporate empirical findings into normative discourse.", "syllabus": "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modes of interaction between theological inquiries and empirical research methods1A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The history of the use of social scientific methods in theological research1B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Examples of how empirical research can be used in theological inquiries\u2014empirical theology and practical theology1C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The principle of \"theological all the way through\"2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Qualitative approaches to inquiry (e.g., narrative, phenomenology and its variants, grounded theory and constructivist grounded theory, ethnography, case study, action research, etc.) 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Methods in qualitative research3A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to ask well-constructed, focused questions3B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The role of theoretical framework in different kinds of qualitative research3C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data collection3Ci.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Methods of sampling3Cii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Qualitative interviewing: structured, semi-structured, unstructured interview; individual in-depth interview and focus group interview, etc.3Ciii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Field observations, ethnography, digital ethnography, etc.3D.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Qualitative data analysis, interpretation, and presentation3Di.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Various types of coding, thematic analysis, theorization, and standard computer-assisted data analysis software such as NVivo3Dii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strategies of data interpretation; the issue of trustworthiness, validity, and generalization4.\u00a0The fundamentals of various quantitative research facets: key-terms and design, research questions, hypothesis, operationalization of concepts, instruments, questionnaire design, population, sample, common types of data analysis (univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis), and standard data analysis software such as SPSS, etc. 5.\u00a0\u00a0How to critically read quantitative research reports6.\u00a0\u00a0The use of mixed methods7.\u00a0\u00a0Research ethics8.

The study of film from serious academic theological perspectives, however, was scarce until the mid 1990s. In this course, we explore a number of approaches by which the theological study of film can take place. These include, for example, the study of explicit representation of religious materials, the 'uncovering' of implicit religious motifs, the use of film as resource for theological reflection and construction. In particular, we shall consider how cinematic representations of certain important theological motifs may enrich conventional religious understanding.

Local examples.\u00a0\u00a0Core Section 2: Interdisciplinary Dialogical Platform to experiment on the ways for theology to engage concrete public issues. Around five public/current issues from the below area-list will be selected each year for the dialogue. Experts or/and experienced practitioners in different fields of practice will be invited to the platform to share with students their analyses of the respective public/current issues, while theological responses (philosophical, exegetical, historical, and practical) will be given by teachers from different sub-disciplines in theology. Students are expected to engage in the dialogue with the theories and concepts they learnt from core section 1, and with their own experience as a citizen. They will also be required to continue the discussion on the eLearning platform (Blackboard) which constitutes one of their homework assignments.\u00a0\u00a01. Land Use in Hong Kong; and, Land in the Hebrew Bible: The dialogue will focus on issues related to sustainability, conservation, development, environmental justice, and theologies of territory in the Hebrew Bible.\u00a0\u00a02. Poverty and Justice in Hong Kong; and, Church and the Struggle for Social Justice: The dialogue will focus on (a) the different ways (social scientific and theological) of describing, categorizing, explaining, and interpreting the phenomenon of poverty in Hong Kong; (b) how can the church build a movement of Christians committed to tackling poverty in Hong Kong?\u00a0\u00a03.
