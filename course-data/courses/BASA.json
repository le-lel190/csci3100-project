The first part is focused on the application of the philosophy of science to behavioral research in business. Basic concepts such as explanation, scientific laws, and theory are introduced and discussed. The second part provides an introduction to the various stages of scientific research which include research design, measurement scale and development, sampling design, data collection and statistical analysis. Even though mathematical proofs and statistical derivations will be reduced to a minimum, having the knowledge of basic statistics and matrix manipulations will be helpful.", "outcome": "After finishing this course, it is expected that students should:\u00a0- Be able to understand and comment on the appropriateness of various methodologies used in survey research\u00a0- Be able to select an appropriate research design independently for their own research\u00a0- Be able to learn new methodologies in the future independently based on what they have learned in this course", "syllabus": "This is a research-oriented graduate level course on research methodology.\u00a0 There are four major objectives of this course:(1) It discusses the nature of scientific quantitative survey research methods;(2) It introduces to graduate students common quantitative statistical techniques used in management survey research;(3) It familiarizes students with key methodological concerns when conducting management research using surveys;\u00a0 (4) It provides students with hand-on knowledge on statistical packages and how they are used in survey-based management research.", "required_readings": " Kerlinger, F.N. & Lee, H.B.
