The course provides an interdisciplinary study of the Earth Systems, including natural phenomena in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere. The mechanism of these systems, associated dynamics and anthropogenic impacts will be introduced and discussed. The course also serves as a platform to understand and critically assess global environmental change, natural hazards, biodiversity loss, and the water-energy-food nexus, and explore potential technological and policy solutions to these problems. These objectives align strongly with the understanding and pursuit of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG#7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG#13 Climate Action, SDG#14 Life Below Water, and SDG#15 Life on Land. In addition to attending lectures, students will visit the Jockey Club Museum of Climate Change where it displays the way scientists examine past and current climate and the factors leading to current global temperature change. A geological field excursion will be another highlight of the course to demonstrate the scientific concepts applied to reveal Earth\u2019s tectonic history, evolution and interaction among various spheres.

The course aims to deepen students' understanding of the local geology, including its formation processes, tectonic history, and its relationship with the environment. By the end of the course, students will have acquired a solid background in local geology and geomorphology. The course emphasizes hands-on training and practical skills development. Students will learn essential geological field techniques, including map reading, gathering geological data, making field observations, and jotting geological field notes. They will also develop critical thinking skills through the analysis and interpretation of geological data. Additionally, the course includes training in life-saving skills to ensure students' safety during fieldwork. EESC2129 consists of a 10-day local field study and five pre-trip lectures. The field study provides an immersive experience where students will directly apply the knowledge and techniques learned in the classroom to real geological settings in Hong Kong. The pre-trip lectures serve as a preparatory phase, covering relevant theoretical concepts, field methodologies, and safety protocols. Following the field study, two post-trip discussions will provide an opportunity for students to share their findings, and engage in further analysis and interpretation. Successful completion of EESC2129 requires continuous teamwork and independent assignments. Students will be expected to collaborate with their peers during fieldwork, share responsibilities, and contribute to group discussions. Additionally, independent assignments will be assigned to reinforce students' understanding of the course material and encourage individual exploration of specific geological topics.Note: This course may involve physical activities and fieldwork in outdoor environments.
