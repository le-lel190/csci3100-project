This course invites students to explore the central components of human language, examining its structure and functions, how it is acquired, and how it changes over time. Students will have an overview of the grammatical properties of language, with respect to its sounds and sound system (phonetics and phonology), words and word formation (morphology), sentence patterns (syntax), and meaning (semantics). The course will highlight the psychological and biological foundations of language, and the applications of linguistics to other fields. Students will develop a basic understanding of language as a computational system that interacts with other cognitive systems of the human brain. The course will also discuss the social aspects of language and the computational processing of human language.

An overview of natural language processing research and practical everyday IT applications will be provided. The strengths and limitations of computers and its implications to language processing will be discussed. \u00a0\u00a02. Tokenization, stemming and word segmentation--Text processing begins with tokenization of text chunks. While it looks like an easy task, it is a non-trivial task for computers. Special attention will be given to the Chinese word segmentation problem where word boundaries are not explicitly indicated in the Chinese writing system.\u00a0\u00a03. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging--POS tagging is a task that enhances the information of the text and critically affects further text processing. POS tagging schemes will be reviewed. The bigram approach to tagging will be demonstrated. \u00a0\u00a04. Corpora-based training and testing--In the last 20 years, the field of natural language processing is dominated by the corpus-oriented approach in all sorts of tasks. This is also an area where linguists\u2019 contribution is important. We will demonstrate how corpora can be used to train and test word segmenter and POS tagger.\u00a0\u00a05.

The generic representation enables computers to quantify the relative \u201cimportance\u201d of words in texts so that keywords or chunks can be selected for retrieval.\u00a0\u00a06.

We will discuss how corpus-based machine learning methods make use of keyword in documents to classify documents into different categories.\u00a0\u00a07.
