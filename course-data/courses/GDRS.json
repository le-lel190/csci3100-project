Having the gender lens in qualitative research lends itself greater importance as it helps to uncover the mechanism and the intersectional social forces giving shape to forms of inequalities, identities, and communities. As AI and big data are the buzz words today to restructure the future work force, qualitative research skills are becoming increasingly important in a world that are gradually governed by machines. People are not satisfied with merely algorithmic associations but want to know the meanings, emotions, sensibility, and identities behind data. Qualitative methods in gender studies capacitate us to engage in deep reflection about the process, dynamics, and the deeper structure of the social world to come up with a better solution to many problems of inequality. Gender studies is an interdisciplinary field, but in this course, we will focus on the qualitative research methods used by feminist inquires in the social sciences. Students will be exposed to a variety of qualitative research methods from fieldwork to beyond. Epistemology of gender research and what is considered feminist research will be introduced. We will cover important qualitative cases and the associated ethical issues.

This interdisciplinary course introduces and examines gender and sexuality from a contemporary and regional perspective. Based on a cross-cultural perspective, we will read and analyze different meanings of gender and sexuality, and how these meanings are constructed. In a context of modernization campaigns and globalization processes, this course illustrates how gender relations and sexual politics are related with historical backgrounds, cultural heritage, market expansion, ideological shifts, and capitalist dynamics. The topics of gender and sexuality will be interwoven with that of migration, work, family, popular culture, mass media, and consumerism. The course will help students to understand issues of discrimination against women and girls, unpaid care and domestic work, access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and equal rights to economic resources, and to reflect on how to promote gender equality (SDG5 among 17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, in the 2030 development agenda). Students will be encouraged to explore localized knowledge and living experiences of gender and sexuality, and to think critically about how to reduce inequality (SDG10) related to social systems of sex and gender.", "outcome": " 1.

Living Feminisms is all about how to put feminism into practice. Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). ", "outcome": " Upon completion of the course, students will acquire both knowledge and skills of social change that are in line with feminist consciousness. Specifically, they will be able to explain the roots of the domination system and a series of factors contributing to its perpetuation, and able to make change by transforming internal and external resistance. Students will be empowered to take lead in change effort through collaboration with others and mastery of conflict transformation skills.\u00a0Students will learn to appreciate making a sustainable future requires transformation in areas broader than the conventionally defined economic realm.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": " Class 1: How We Got Where We Are and Where Are We Heading? \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Riane Eisler and Douglas P.

This course examines the social construction of minorities and the history of Hong Kong public policy towards them, including legal changes, social institutions, immigration policy, and political mobilization. Current debates in public policies such as anti-discrimination legislation, education policies of ethnic minorities, disciplining of youth and anti-poverty scheme will also be evaluated within this context. We will draw on an array of intellectual resources ranging from political economy, critical race theory, feminism, phenomenology and queer theory to examine issues about racial/ethnic minorities, the economically underprivileged, minorities with disabilities, sexual/erotic minorities, gender minorities and youth in light of the latest scholarly discussions on multiculturalism, pluralism and the politics of difference and social recognition.The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) with a focus on how public policy plays an important role in obstructing and facilitating the attainment of these goals.", "outcome": "  Upon completion of the course, students will be able to  1. describe how minorities are historically, socially and economically constructed and their lived experiences;  2. understand and identify issues pertinent to multifarious minorities in Hong Kong with political economy, feminist, critical race theory phenomenological and queer approaches;  3. identify and analyse in what way power relations are established and resisted in the construction of minorities and the social as well as institutional responses to them in the form of public policy. 4. increase awareness of SDGs, particularly the relevance of public policy to the attainment of these goals \u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": " 1 Conceptualizing Public Policy -\u00a0\u00a0 To give students a schematic view of the course -\u00a0\u00a0 To understand various approaches to defining public

This course examines issues revolving the family as a social institution in different cultures. It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion. The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, in particular SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3011", "title": "Women's Narratives and Hong Kong History", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Field Studies/Field-trip\nLecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Gender Studies Pgm Comm", "requirements": "", "description": "(UGED3206 is double-coded with GDRS3011.)  In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of \u2018collective memory\u2019 of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of \u2018the past\u2019. This act of remembering and exploring \u2018our history\u2019 questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity \u2014 personal, collective, and spatial \u2014 in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong\u2019s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites\u2019 households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women\u2019s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": " It is anticipated that on completing the course, students will be able to:  \u00a0 \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 identify major areas and topics regarding the study of women\u2019s lives and experiences in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 analyse and discuss in what ways gender has been an organizing force in shaping families, professions, education, and social movements in Hong Kong history  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 examine one\u2019s self identity in complex historical and social contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 evaluate competing narratives of a \u2018Hong Kong Story\u2019 from a gender and historical perspective  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 apply first-hand knowledge and skills in writing history relating the personal to the social, cultural, political and economic contexts  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 recognize the interconnections between different sources of inequality and oppression \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0critically engage with notions of social justice and social transformation  \u00a0  \u00a0", "syllabus": "\u00a0A\u00a0 INTRODUCTION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Introduction: Revisiting Hong Kong\u2019s history (1840s -1990s) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 Methodology: Narrative, Auto/biography and Oral HistoryB\u00a0 WOMEN IN THE FAMILY: Servitude, Lineage, and Family Networks in pre-war Hong Kong\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 Protected Women, san po tsai, mui tsai and concubines \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4 Village women and boat women\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5 Merchants\u2019 daughters: women in the elite families \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C\u00a0 WOMEN AND FEMALE EDUCATION : From Protection to Modernisation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 European missionaries and nuns\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7 Local headmistresses and teachers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8 Girls going to school and universityD\u00a0 WOMEN AT WORK: Gender, Work and Professions\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9 Brothel keepers and prostitutes in the 19th Century\u00a0\u00a0 10 Nurses and doctors (1920s-1980s)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 11 Factory workers (1960s-1990s)\u00a0E\u00a0 WOMEN IN PHILANTHROPY AND SOCIAL ACTIVISM (1910s-1970s): Public Voice for the Private Sphere\u00a0\u00a0 12 Leaders of the anti-mui tsai campaign, the campaign against licensed prostitution, the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YWCA and the Family Planning Association", "required_readings": "Primary SourcesSelected documents from archives of mission societies, girls\u2019 schools, and charities.Published Secondary SourcesHong Kong History and Women\u2019s HistoryNgo, Tak-wing (ed.)

Institutions such as lineage and family, marriage, religion, medical practices, art, education and politics shape our life patterns as well as social mores.

Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

Educational and occupational accomplishments vary dramatically among individuals and profoundly affect lives. Importantly, gender is among the powerful individual characteristics that affect people's experiences in educational and work settings. Gender shapes youths' experience and outcomes of education across the globe and across history. This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the intersection of gender, education and jobs. The topics address the role of gender in school- and related preferences and achievements, with a focus on social and cognitive approaches. For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues. Particular attention will be paid to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international. Empirical evidence will be reviewed to illustrate the gender biases and substantiate the explanatory theories.

This course examines the gender dimensions of innovation and novelty. The key questions are: How/Why/What/When innovation(s) are gendered? We will discuss the fluidity and messiness of doing and undoing gender in innovation practices and meanings produced. Broadly defined, innovation refers to new ideas, new knowledge, new technologies, new designs, and creative practices with the goal to solve social or technical problems. Many innovations may seem gender-neutral but are inherently imbued with gender perceptions. The course will equip students with ways to apply gender analysis to decipher innovations and innovative processes. The course incorporates sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities to become more discerning toward more sustainable practices to advance Industry Innovation and Infrastructure. Using case studies from the technology culture, the routine practices, and the emergent new economy, students will learn to untangle how gender intersects with the seemingly neutral artefacts of innovation and technology. The course further covers how emergent issues of diversity and inclusion, AI and information technology, social entrepreneurship and social innovation, and leadership style could reshape the existing relationship between gender and innovation to advance sustainability and social resilience.", "outcome": " By the end of the course, committed students will have attained: \u00a0 \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A deeper understanding of how innovations and technologies are gendered \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A sense of the distinctive and shared views in reflecting how gender shapes innovation and entrepreneurship \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Knowledge and ability to apply gender analysis to identify and describe different processes of innovation and entrepreneurship \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reflexive Insights into the power dynamics played by individuals and institutions in the creation of novelty \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ability to synthesize different theoretical traditions and disciplines that study gender and innovation \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Capability to evaluate technology and science-based entrepreneurial projects on their inherent gender assumptions and provide relevant suggestions \u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": " Week 1: Introduction: When are Innovation(s) Gendered? \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Innovations in science and technology often seemed gender-neutral, when do they become gendered?  \u00b7\u00a0 To innovate for a more sustainable future, having SDG goals in mind are important in any innovative ventures, and the course begins with the SDG goals on gender equality and reduced inequality to identify gaps in science and technology. \u00a0 Week2: Doing and Undoing Gender in Innovation \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will discuss the ways that gender analysis contributes to our understanding of innovation. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Embedding gender analysis in science research could help filter out inherent biases to further advance the innovative processes. \u00a0 Week 3: Why/How is Innovation Gendered? \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While debates about the gender dimensions of technology are many, has feminism changed science?

This course examines the rich tradition of feminist film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates. Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad.

This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media.

How do we understand the notion of \u201cminority\u201d? And how does \u201cminority\u201d, look like, in cinema? This course examines the rich tradition of critical film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates, concerning \u201cminority\u201d identities and subalternity. Addressing key discussions about media representations of \u201cminority\u201d, the course will look at the politics of representation and its impacts, both on- and off-screen. We will be looking at how media works to construct \u201cthe Other\u201d in different contexts, and delve into important work which have inspired minority cinema, subaltern cinema, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, and independent cinema among other counter-movements, as well as recent re-conceptualizations and exploration of representations marginalized identities, positions, and experiences, local and abroad.

Lacking representations both behind the camera and in front of it, how are the lives of different social \u201cminorities\u201d affected by biased media representations? How are stereotypes and biases created, disseminated, perpetuated, and reproduced through media, and to what consequences? Mulvey\u2019s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the standings of different socially and culturally marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, queer communities, and people with disabilities, etc., as spectacle or passive object \u201cin films cut to the measure of desire\u201d of the dominant social groups.What happens when \u201cminority\u201d artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? Critics showed how different marginalized groups around the world attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. Minority cinemas and independent creators have been actively carving out space to tell their own unique stories of lives at the margin in dramatically different cultural contexts, and these images are further complicated by engagements with them through the intersecting lens including ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, ability, queerness, and more.In the course, we will look at how socially marginalized groups, such as gay and lesbians, transgender persons, ethnic minorities, women in different stages of their lives, people with mental illness, teenagers, the elderlyand many others are portrayed, and seek to expand their on-screen existence in Hong Kong media. In the exploration, we will engage with key questions in critical film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, systems of media production, pro-sumer culture, (g)local cinema, alternative cinema, and new media.

We will look at Filipina, Vietnamese and Chinese women migrating to Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the United States for marriage and employment. We will discuss issues related to labor and marriage migrations, as well as trafficking in women, on both macro- and micro-levels. We are going to ask: how does the global economic restructuring shape the gendered migration today? What makes female labor different from male labor in the global labor market? What are push-and-pull factors that trigger these women to leave their hometown to be workers or wives in foreign countries? What difficulties do they experience after entering host societies and what impact would the migration flow bring to both laborer/bride receiving and sending countries? Moreover, we will explore the global market formation of transnational commodified marriages between women from developing countries and men from more developed countries. Taking the matchmaking industry in Taiwan and Vietnam for example, we will ask: how should we perceive the subjectivity of women who marry abroad through brokers? How could we challenge the assumption that the brokerage business in transnational marriage is part of human trafficking practice, and women involved in this activity are victims? To better address this issue, we may also need to address the question: what is trafficking in women? How are women represented in the global anti-trafficking campaign and how the politics of charity influences the state\u2019s immigration policymaking and women\u2019s transnational mobility? We will approach these issues from a critical perspective in order to challenge given social perception that ignores women's agency at work. Throughout the semester, we will read theoretical and empirical works from many disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, political economy and women's studies. In addition, we will read primary source materials including news reports, online forums and watch documentaries and film clips.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4012", "title": "Gender Development from a Lifespan Perspective", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Gender Studies Pgm Comm", "requirements": "", "description": "Humans all over the world are inevitably gendered, either voluntarily or involuntarily, in tangible behavior and in perception, from birth to death.Indeed, it is difficult to identify an aspect of human existence, be it ability, health, preferences, beliefs or opportunities,that does not have some flavor of gender. These gender phenomena do not arise from nowhere in adulthood but can be traced from childhood following a complex interplay of social, cognitive, and biological processes. They manifest in rich forms at various points of development. This course tackles the study of gender from a human developmental perspective, with the aim of understanding how gender phenomena arise, develop and change from infancy to older age, how they can be described and how to explain them with an eclectic theoretical approach that balances various developmental forces. The course also emphasizes an understanding of the methodology in empirical studies of age-related changes and causes and consequences of behaviours. Students are expected to engage actively in the identification and analysis of the relevant issues in real life, both of others and their own. At the end of the course, students will gain a critical understand of the role of gender in shaping human development, gain insight into what has led them to become who they are, and be more informed about how to deal with gender phenomena constructively at various life stages.", "outcome": "After completion of this course, students are expected to:\u00a01.

As a discipline, gender studies draws on a variety of knowledge in humanities and social science and shapes its methodology and methods to challenge existing hegemonic knowledge that is considered being produced scientifically. The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the intellectual debate between feminist epistemology and scientific knowledge production as well as to equip them with the abilities of critical thinking about their methodologies and conducting research with proper methods. Topics include: 1) critical questioning of the validity of knowledge production, the power relations between the researcher and his or her research subjects, and the representation of the research and the researcher; 2) cautiously examining the influence of globalization on feminist research and the intersectionality among race, class and gender; and 3) innovatively connecting theory with praxis through participatory action and writing. We will begin with a brief introduction to the history and development of feminist research, followed by discussions on feminist methodologies by exemplary researchers. In the final weeks, we will shift our focus to the application of theory and groundbreaking feminist writing through collaboration. To make sure students are capable of conducting their own research using a feminist framework, this course also requests students to conduct a mini study and engage in narrative analyses. After taking this course, students are expected to be familiar with feminist approaches of conducting research and able to reflect on the knowledge production of their own research in the future.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5030", "title": "Advanced Topics in Gender Studies I", "career": "Postgraduate - Research", "units": "1.50", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Seminar", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Gender Studies", "requirements": "For students in MA Gender Studies, MPhil Gender Studies, PhD Gender Studies, MPhil-PhD Gender Studies", "description": "This seminar aims at engaging students in the most current researches in gender studies, providing them with intellectual stimulation and support for the preparation of the M.Phil./ Ph.D. thesis.

In particular, this course brings a cross-disciplinary dialogue to the influences of diverse genders and sexualities on everyday life. It argues that although diverse genders and sexualities are seemingly \u2018private decisions\u2019, there are also lots of \u2018public dialogues\u2019 about them. The course examines the lives of LGBTQI+ people in diverse domains of life, such as employment, education, and health care, and analyzes some contemporary development in policy and practice. As a whole, the course calls for reflections on living with differences in contemporary society.", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:\u00a01. Address issues surrounding the construction of gender/sexuality and the changing relations and sexual politics in the context of global modernities;\u00a02.

Why does gender matter in shaping the experience of work? Beginning with these questions, this course explores the distinct positions of men and women in the workplace and in the labor markets and examines gender relationship, gender segregation and gender discrimination across a variety of research topics on farm work, factory work, migrant work, business, housework, service work, entertainment and leisure. We will be reading about, analyzing, and discussing diverse empirical studies on men and women as workers, homemakers, care workers, organizers, or entrepreneurs, which provide fresh ways to look at the relationship between gender and work. This course provides students with key concepts and theories about the gendered institutions of economic development, organization, migration, and culture.
