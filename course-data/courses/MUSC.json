By engaging with styles and performance practices from various regions and historical eras, students will develop an understanding of the diverse ways in which music intersects with human experience, culture, and history. To this end, the course employs an issue-based approach. The first several class sessions deal with fundamental questions about music, such as: What is music? How do musical sounds communicate meaning? What are the relationships between musical sounds, contexts, listening habits, and human behavior? How and why do scholars study music? The remainder of the semester is devoted to particular case studies that explore music\u2019s relationship to other realms including politics, religion, identity, and globalization. The class is structured around interactive lectures, demonstrations, discussion, and in-class group activities. No prior musical background or training is required.", "outcome": "Students will: Become familiar with a broad range of musics and performance practices from diverse geographical locations and historical eras Cultivate frameworks for understanding and analyzing music as a social and cultural practice Develop fundamental skills in music research\u2014how to read, listen, think, and write critically about music Learn to listen critically and closely, and identify musical sounds and structures through in-depth audition and discussion of musical examples Become familiar with diverse academic approaches to the study of music", "syllabus": "Course syllabus will vary from semester to semester, and will be distributed by the professor teaching the course at the start of the term.
