In particular, this course will emphasize the historical and cultural shaping of health disparities and examine how issues of power contribute to unequal patterns of risk and disease in our modern society. To do this, students will learn major theories and methods in the cultural study of health and medicine to understand how culture, power, and identity\u2014including race, gender, capitalism, and colonialism\u2014 shapes the management of disease and individual illness experience in both Asian and global contexts. A critical concern in this course is how the organization of medical care confronts questions of social justice in medical treatment and public health in historical and contemporary contexts. Students will also grapple with the question of whether our institutions of medicine and public health function as a form of social control. By introducing students to the social components of health and illness, it aims to foster cross-disciplinary conversations across the faculties of arts, medicine, and other divisions at CUHK.Following the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal of Reducing Inequality (SDG #10), a central question in this course is how medical treatments, research, and public health confront, or fail to confront, issues of social justice in global contexts. Students will learn theoretical approaches to health and inequality to investigate how history, culture, and politics shape the illness experience of socially marginalized people. These theories will enable students to assess the strengths and limits of our current arrangements of medical care and approaches to global health. In addition, students will learn critical medical humanities methods, such as ethnography, and use these methods to propose solutions to our current shortcomings in health governance. This course will challenge students to imagine better alternatives to our unequal world and demonstrate why the study of culture matters in medicine, global health, and public policy.", "outcome": "-Analyze how social inequality shapes disease outcomes (SDG #10)-Explain how media shapes public understandings of health and disease, including stigma-Situate individual illness experience in the social, political, and cultural contexts of disease-Implement the use of ethnography to develop health policies that can reduce inequality (SDG #10)", "syllabus": "Introduction: Critical Medical HumanitiesIn this introductory class, students will learn about the critical medical humanities as a method for interrogating fundamental questions of social justice in medicine: who gets sick, who gets better, and why? Students will be introduced to basic theories and concepts in the cultural studies of health and disease, such as stigma, biopolitics, and illness discourse, as tools for analyzing the complex social forces that shape health disparities. In addition, students will be provided with a basic introduction to public health systems, as well as information about the places and time periods that will be covered in the course.\u00a0Unit One: Race and DiseaseThis unit starts with the histories of international disease control in Asian contexts, with emphasis on how social, cultural, and racial differences shaped the management of disease in colonial spaces. Students will analyze how issues of power and identity inform public health interventions, which often protects the privileged while stigmatizing and harming others. We will use the Hong Kong plague outbreak of 1894 as a case study in health inequity and learn, for example, about the homes of migrant Chinese labourers being burned by colonial officials in the name of disease control. We will conclude the unit by reflecting on how ideas of race and other forms social difference still shape the framing of disease even in contemporary discourses. Students will utilize cultural theories on race, gender, class, and inequality to identify how social biases shapes disease perception and response to reduce health inequality.1.\u00a0 Difference and Disease in Tropical MedicineKey themes: hygienic modernity, power/knowledge, the \u201cnative\u201d body, the laboratory in colonial discourse, vaccine politics2.\u00a0\u00a0Colonial Tensions in Hong Kong\u2019s Plague PandemicKey themes: race and space, epidemic orientalism, the politics of quarantine and sanitary regimes, germ theory vs. local knowledge\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0Representing DiseaseKey themes: cultural representations of \u201cthe other\u201d in disease discourse, endemicity as a cultural concept, body politics, the role of media in shaping disease response, global healthUnit Two: The Politics of Identity in Medicine\u00a0Why are doctors often men? Why do doctors often come from socially dominant groups in terms of ethnicity and class privilege? What are the implications for how medicine is practiced? This unit offers answers to some of these questions by exploring the power structures that shape our institutions of medicine. We start with examining the social power of physicians. Students will learn about the social factors that shape how medical conditions come to be recognized, and the populations that are excluded or harmed in the pursuit of medical advancement. By understanding the politics of identity in medicine, students will gain the conceptual tools for understanding the health disparities that result when medicine often reflects the interests of socially dominant groups. Course discussions will invite students to apply concepts learned in this unit to address health disparities here in Hong Kong, where ethnic minorities representing 8.4% of the population face barriers in accessing care,\u00a0mental health resources are not yet able to address demand, and a fragile public health system offers diminished care for the city\u2019s neediest.4. Physician Power\u00a0Key themes: medicalization, normal vs. pathological, social control, illness narrative5. Medical ExperimentationKey themes: medical mistrust, medical gaze, ethical variation, biopolitics, bare life\u00a06. Gender and Medicine IKey themes: gender discrimination in medicine, bias in clinical research, androcentrism, experiential knowledge, situated knowledge7. Gender and Medicine IIKey themes: patient activism, advocacy, biosociality, online communities\u00a0Unit Three: Medicine, Power, and Structural Violence\u00a0In this final unit, we will connect individual illness experiences to the broader social, economic, and structural factors that result in ill health, such as poverty, uneven development, forced migration, and others. This unit will emphasize the illness experiences of marginalized social groups to examine the effects of social, political, and economic disenfranchisement on their bodies and health. By examining health and illness at the level of everyday life, students will develop an understanding of how ethnographic methods can be used to make interventions in health policy. In the concluding week, we will wrap up with a discussion about who benefits, and who may be harmed, in our current global health system and propose ways to align global health priorities with the principles health justice.8.

In this visual age, while we are bombarded with more and more visual information and sensations, we are also effectively deskilled in our capacities as interpretive beings in critically engaging with these visual representations. This course teaches students how to appreciate the rich hermeneutic possibilities inherent in the visual culture and at the same time to be critical of ways that the viewers are rendered vulnerable to be manipulated by the visual images.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2032", "title": "Youth and Popular Culture", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "This course studies the relationship between youth and popular culture, specifically in view of the rapidly expanding youth culture in recent years.

We also examine how youth identity is constructed around the dynamics between mainstream identity and subcultural identity, and students are given the chance to analyse their own socio-cultural worlds in the various cultural environment, including home, school, concerts, shopping malls, youth magazines, and the cyber-space.

How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William\u2019s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3006", "title": "Special Topics in Cultural Studies", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "The specific topics of this course vary from year to year.

We will first focus on this problematic by tracing a particular set of questions through which knowledge about Islam and Muslim politics has been produced. By reading excerpts from scholarly works and influential media outlets, by watching documentaries, and through discussions during the class, we will develop a framework in which to recognize, understand and appreciate the gamut of political predicaments that Islamic tradition and its practitioners face under modern conditions. By the end of the first half of this course, students are expected to develop the ability to engage the following questions: What kind of assumptions about Islam and politics inform popular discussions on this topic? How has the rise of modern state power shaped and reshaped Muslims\u2019 understanding of their tradition? What forms of lives, histories and struggles can and cannot be captured by this problematic? We will then spend the last several weeks exploring case studies that are considered to be paradigmatic of Islamic politics today.

The aim of the course is to show that pornography is a not a unified screen culture but consists of varied representations within cultural contexts. The course will teach students how to analyze these representations and how to take into account their cultural histories. The course will take a Cultural Studies approach and examine within specific cultural environments and include the positions of anti-porn and pro-porn activists. Therefore students will get an overview of diverging perspectives while being encouraged to consider their own values and critical responses. Students will be asked to respond to theories and audio-visual examples, while actively partaking in debates about pornography and its impact on religion, gender, sexuality, health, labor and economy. Finally, the course will pay special importance to how contemporary sexually explicit media are impacting new user groups such young adult netizens, female consumers, disabled people, as well as ethnic and sexual minorities. Students will carry out a major assignment while learning how to apply ethnographic research methods to analyze representations of the body and sexuality within screen cultures. In this assignment, they will focus on a media environment/platform and a sexual culture of their choice to find out how culture is being redefined and visualized by media users. Two workshops will be organized in the media lab in order to train the students in different methods and perspectives on digital ethnographyLanguage of instruction: Classes and assignments will be carried out in the English language and students\u2019 active participation in both lectures and tutorials will be required. Students can carry out ethnographic fieldwork in Cantonese or any language of your choice, but need to present the results in English.Learning Activities: Students are required to attend a 3-hour class each week. The course combines theoretical lectures with the viewing of films and media examples. There will also be tutorial sessions each week based on the lectures and on the weekly readings. All students are required to post weekly reflections on Blackboard and to participate in discussions. In addition to the weekly readings and reflections, students will conduct research and planning for their assessments and oral presentations independently and in groups.Please be advised that this course will involve some screenings and discussions of sexually explicit materials and category III films.

It will balance a historical and theoretical overview of the concepts and principles of 3D digital animation alongside teaching students the skills for working with the free, open-source 3D creation software Blender to produce animations and 3D models. The course will be based in the computer lab with workshops held every week covering the fundamentals of 3D modeling; sculpting meshes, texturing, lighting, rigging and rendering animations as well as creative design principles of 3D animation. The course takes the definition of the 'postdigital' as a description of our contemporary relation to the internet and technology from the post-2000's when it is no longer perceived as 'new' but integrated into the fabric of our daily lives. It will examine how postdigital animation has been integrated into multiple interfaces (smartphones, laptops, pads), media (film, video, digital) and platforms (theatres, exhibitions) and focus specifically on the Asian context, looking at the works of various artists working with animation and how they have moved beyond translating traditional media into new media through 'remediation' (Manovich: 2014), to create entirely new aesthetic vocabularies in virtual spaces. Students will be expected to create a short 3D animated film as the final assessment which demonstrates a thorough understanding of 3D modeling techniques and the digital animation production process taught over the course of the semester. Additionally, the students will be expected to critically evaluate and understand how contemporary Asian artists are using 3D animation as a part of their practice to creatively express their responses to Asian society, culture and history. Students will critically engage with readings each week which will ultimately give them a through understanding of key issues relevant to contemporary animation in academia and in pop culture. The ultimate outcome for the course is that students are able to use the tools and skills involved in 3D animation to become artists themselves or integrate it into their professional roles as filmmakers, designers, curators or art administration professionals.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4121", "title": "Chan School of Buddhism", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "The Chan movement has been described by Hu Shih as a reformation or revolution in Buddhism and by Suzuki as a movement in which the Chinese mind completely asserted itself, in a sense, in opposition to the Indian mind.
