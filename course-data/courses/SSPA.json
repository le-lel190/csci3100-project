The essence of the course is to put theory into practice. Due to the nature of application students are required to complete at least 12 credits of course work. Students enrolled in the attachment will continue their other course works in the regular terms, and could simultaneously engage in practical attachment at any time during the course of the MSc study, with mutual agreement between the course supervisor and the field tutor. Opportunity and selection of the interested industry can be initiated by the students and/or recommended by the course supervisor. Students should engage in not less than 100 hours in field placement to be agreed upon by your supervisor and field tutor. During the attachment period students are required to conduct a specialize projects and submit a project report at the end for grading purpose.
