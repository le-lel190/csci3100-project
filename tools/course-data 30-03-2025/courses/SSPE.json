It provides an opportunity for students to review the literature of their fields of specialization and to prepare for the writing of their project proposals. Examples are topics within the areas of biomechanics, exercise physiology, sports management, sports psychology, etc. A student is expected to read according to a reading list prescribed or approved by the supervisors and to confer regularly and frequently with the supervisor. Assessment is based on the completion of reading and course requirements.", "outcome": "At the completion of this course students will be able to:\u00a0\u2022 Familiarize with the research skills in terms of literature review, information retrieval, research design, and relevant theories being applied in sports science and physical education settings.\u00a0\u2022 Discuss theories and issues that impact on their daily work as sports professionals. \u00a0\u2022 Critically analyze the quality of published studies.\u00a0\u2022 Design a research study in a chosen area.\u00a0\u2022 Develop the skills of written and oral presentation for scientific work", "syllabus": "There are no lectures and set week-to-week tasks in this course.
