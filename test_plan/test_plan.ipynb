    "### 2. Tools and Software\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing Tools:\n",
    "1. Test Management Tools:\n",
    "   - In many development workflows, test cases for unit testing and integration testing are often stored directly in the code repository.\n",
    "     These tests are typically written and maintained by developers and are executed automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline, such as\n",
    "     `Github Actions`. Unlike unit and integration tests, regression test cases are often more comprehensive and may reside in standalone\n",
    "     repositories. These repositories are managed separately because:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - They may include large datasets or complex test scenarios.\n",
    "     - They are often executed less frequently (e.g., nightly builds or before major releases).\n",
    "     - They may require specialized tools or environments.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     While CI/CD tools handle the automation of test execution, specialized test management tools such as `Testiny` provide a more\n",
    "     comprehensive solution for managing the entire testing lifecycle. These tools help with:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Organizing test cases.\n",
    "     - Tracking test execution.\n",
    "     - Reporting test results.\n",
    "     - Managing test environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bug Tracking Tools:\n",
    "   - Tools like `Jira`, `Bugzilla`, `Github`, and `Gitlab` to log, track, and manage defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Automation Tools/Human:\n",
    "   - Tools like Selenium for automating test cases for web applications with graphical user interfaces.\n",
    "   - In game development, the UI tends to undergo frequent changes throughout the process, and manual testing is essential since user experience (UX) is crucial for creating a product designed to be enjoyable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Performance Testing Tools:\n",
    "   - Tools like `cProfile` or Unity Profiler to test the game’s performance under load.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2. Agile Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Agile model, testing is integrated into the development process and occurs iteratively throughout the project lifecycle. Testing activities are planned for each sprint (unit of development time to finish certain goals, usually 2-week), and the timeline is flexible to accommodate changes in requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Phases and Timeline:\n",
    "1. Sprint Planning and Preparation: Day 1 of each sprint\n",
    "   - Collaborate with the team to define acceptance criteria for user stories.\n",
    "   - Write initial test cases and scenarios.\n",
    "   - Prepare the test environment and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Testing During the Sprint: Ongoing (Daily)\n",
    "   - Execute test cases for completed user stories.\n",
    "   - Perform exploratory testing for edge cases.\n",
    "   - Log and report bugs to developers.\n",
    "   - Conduct regression testing to ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mid-Sprint Testing Milestones: Midpoint of each sprint\n",
    "   - Perform integration testing for newly developed features.\n",
    "   - Update test cases based on changes or clarifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. End-of-Sprint Testing Activities: Last 1–2 days of each sprint\n",
    "   - Conduct final acceptance testing for all completed user stories.\n",
    "   - Perform system testing to validate the overall functionality.\n",
    "   - Execute smoke tests to ensure the application is stable for the sprint review/demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Post-Sprint Activities: After each sprint\n",
    "   - Perform regression testing on the integrated build.\n",
    "   - Update the test suite with new test cases for future regression testing.\n",
    "   - Automate additional test cases, if applicable.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation\n",
    "Identify potential challenges and obstacles that could impact testing,  and the strategies to address or minimize these risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Risks:\n",
    "1. Delays in Development: Could impact the testing schedule.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Regular communication with the development team to adjust timelines as needed.\n",
    "2. High Bug Volume: May overwhelm the testing team.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical bugs and allocate additional resources if necessary.\n",
    "3. Compatibility Issues: Game may not perform well on all supported platforms.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Conduct thorough compatibility testing early in the process.\n",
    "4. Insufficient Resources:\n",
    "   - Risk: Lack of testers, tools, or devices.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical test cases and borrow resources from other teams if needed.\n",
    "5. Intrinsic Untestability:\n",
    "   - Risk: Some features cannot be easily tested with automated testing tools. For example, features with highly complex algorithms, AI-driven behaviour, or dynamic decision-making processes that are difficult to predict or replicate in a test environment.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Make the software be able to expose as many internal states as possible. For example, for a game AI, provide a debug mode that outputs and logs decision-making steps to help testers understand its behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Success Criteria\n",
    "Establish clear criteria for evaluating testing progress and determining when testing objectives have been successfully achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All critical and high-priority bugs are resolved.\n",
    "- Game meets performance benchmarks on all supported platforms.\n",
    "- Positive feedback from UAT participants.\n",
    "- All test cases pass with no major issues.\n",
    "- Game is approved for release by stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Reporting Requirements\n",
    "Outline how test results will be recorded, monitored, and shared with stakeholders throughout the testing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation:\n",
    "- Description of the test cases in the code repository or dedicated test repository.\n",
    "- Test case execution reports.\n",
    "- Bug reports with detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and screenshots/videos.\n",
    "- Weekly progress updates to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication:\n",
    "- Regular meetings with the development team to discuss testing progress and blockers.\n",
    "- Final test summary report to stakeholders before release.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This test plan provides a structured approach to ensure the Pokeman game is thoroughly tested and ready for release."
